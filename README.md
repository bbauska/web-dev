> About the Authors
>
> **Joshua Johanan** is a web developer who currently lives in South
> Bend, Indiana. He has been a web developer for five years. He has
> built sites using many different languages, including PHP, Python,
> JavaScript, and C#; although if asked, he would prefer using Python
> and JavaScript. These languages have led him to use different MVC
> frameworks, such as Zend Framework, Django, and .Net\'s MVC.
>
> As you can see from this book, Joshua has also used JavaScript on both
> the backend with Node.js and frontend using many different libraries.
> These include Backbone, React, jQuery, and plain old JavaScript.
>
> He currently works for a healthcare organization, writing websites in
> C#. This does not allow him to utilize the latest flashy browser
> technologies, but it does enforce good development skills, such as
> maintainability and scalability.
>
> This is his first book, but he does post somewhat regularly on his
> blog at [http://](http://ejosh.co/de/)
> [ejosh.co/de/](http://ejosh.co/de/).
>
> I would like to thank my wife, Liz, for her support through the
> writing of this book. I would also like to thank Dexter and Gizmo, who
> hung out by my feet as I wrote most of this book.
>
> **Talha Khan** is a passionate web developer, JavaScript enthusiast,
> software consultant, and coffee freak from Pakistan who is currently
> residing in UAE. He has more than five years of experience in this
> field. Despite graduating in mathematics and statistics, his love for
> web technologies pushed him toward the field of web technologies. He
> is experienced in developing interactive websites and web applications
> using PHP, MYSQL, and Dot Net Suite along with HTML, CSS, and
> JavaScript libraries. He has been teaching web development as well and
> is an active contributor on programming forums such as StackOverflow.
> Occasionally, he tweets at \@alphaprofile.
>
> Talha has worked and consulted on various projects for several major
> brands and companies. Tossdown.com, a leading restaurants and food
> search engine of Pakistan, is among one of his major achievements. He
> is also running his own start-up while educating newbies on
> technology. He is currently working as a software architect for UAE\'s
> biggest swimming academy, Hamilton Aquatics.
>
> I want to thank my parents for keeping me motivated and my friends who
> supported me in writing, as I could count on them anytime if I had to
> use their laptop. I am also grateful to Tahir Ali Khan, who helped me
> at every step throughout my career and was like a guiding light.
>
> I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the teachers and
> mentors who helped me shape my career and helped me whenever I needed
> it. These people were my source of inspiration. A special thanks to
> Omair Bangash, who took the risk of employing someone from a non-IT
> background and taught me to a level where I am now teaching others.
> His confidence in me was enough to push me to reach to my goals. I
> worked under many projects of various scales and technologies under
> his supervision. He helped me at every step to hone my skills. I
> don\'t think I would be have been able to write this book had it not
> been for his constant support and motivation.
>
> Without learning from these teachers, there is not a chance I could be
> doing what I do today, and it is because of them and others who I may
> not have listed here that I feel compelled to pass my knowledge on to
> those willing to learn.
>

> understand and assimilate.
>
> Ricardo has a master\'s degree in publicity and advertising and has
> deep passion for understanding human behavior. He also has a fiercely
> competitive PC gaming hunger. Together, all this has allowed him to
> switch from the creative side of the
>
> brain to the rational side very easily, allowing him to visualize and
> create technically sound web and mobile designs that are responsive,
> perform well, and convey the proper message through design.

> Publishing*. He\'s also the organizer of the CodePen Dayton meetup

>
> A huge and infinite thanks to my wife, Heather, and my beautiful son,
> Ricardo. They are my inspiration to be a better professional, a better
> person, a better husband, and a better dad.
>
> To my mom, Socorro, who showed me the values that made me the man I am
> today. To my dad, Ricardo \"Pinta\" Zea, for teaching me to be
> determined to not only be good at what I do but to be the best I can
> be.
>
> To God, for allowing me to share with everyone my knowledge of CSS.
>
> And to you, the readers, for giving me the chance to help you be
> better web professionals.

# Preface

> This book covers many concepts that any web developer may need to
> know. These concepts may be new or known, but forgotten. The first two
> chapters in this book will cover the basic elements and attributes of
> HTML. The next four chapters will cover the concepts and syntax of
> CSS. JavaScript will be the focus of the next five chapters. Finally,
> we will cover external libraries. These include Bootstrap, jQuery, and
> Angular. Because this is a reference guide, it is not set up as a

## What this book covers

> *Chapter 1*, *HTML Elements*, covers all the elements that you will
> need when building a web page. This is focused on HTML5.
>
> *Chapter 2*, *HTML Attributes*, focuses on any the attributes that can
> be used with HTML elements.
>
> *Chapter 3*, *CSS Concepts and Applications,* focuses on selectors.
> Selectors are core to determining which elements the CSS attributes
> apply to.
>
> *Chapter 4*, *CSS Properties -- Part I*, covers properties for
> animation, background, the box model, CSS units, columns, and the
> mighty Flexbox.
>
> *Chapter 5*, *CSS Properties -- Part II*, covers properties for fonts,
> transforms, transitions, positions, text, tables, words and
> paragraphs, and paging.
>
> *Chapter 6*, *CSS Properties -- Part III*, covers properties for the
> page box, lists, counters, drop shadows, display and visibility,
> clipping and masking, user interface, and 3D.
>
> *[Preface]{.underline}*
>
> *Chapter 7*, *CSS Functions*, covers functions for filters,
> transforms, colors, gradients, and values. It covers a few extra
> concepts like at-rules, global keyword values, and miscellaneous.
>
> *Chapter 8*, *JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics, and Variable
> Types*, talks about JavaScript implementations and language basics,
> including syntax and variables and their types. This chapter will
> enable us to understand and get started with basic scripting.
>
> *Chapter 9*, *JavaScript Expressions, Operators, Statements, and
> Arrays*, enables us to advance with our basic JavaScript language
> understanding and introduces JavaScript expressions, basic operators,
> statements, loops, conditions, and arrays. This also covers examples
> for better understanding.
>
> *Chapter 10*, *JavaScript Object-Orientated Programming*, explains the
> basic concepts of object-oriented programming, that is, inheritance,
> polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. You will also learn the
> usage of objects, classes, and related methods. We will cover examples
> for better understanding.
>
> *Chapter 11*, *Extending JavaScript and ECMA Script 6*, covers all the
> newly introduced features of ECMAScript 6, which was released in 2015,
> such as new objects, patterns, syntax changes, and new methods on
> existing objects. This chapter covers all these features in detail.
>
> *Chapter 12*, *Server-side JavaScript -- NodeJS*, continues to focus
> on JavaScript. The difference is that we will now write JavaScript on
> the server side instead of the client side. We can use the concepts
> covered in the other JavaScript chapters in addition to learning
> specific NodeJS objects and paradigms.
>
> *Chapter 13*, *Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend Framework*, talks
> about Bootstrap, which is an intuitive framework for creating
> responsive websites. It uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This chapter
> will give you a detailed look at the Bootstrap framework and will
> enable you to create responsive layouts and web pages. Each topic in
> this chapter has a relevant example.
>
> *Chapter 14*, *jQuery -- The Popular JavaScript Library*, focuses on
> jQuery, which is a JavaScript library that simplifies dealing with
> various aspects of an HTML document. In this chapter, you will learn
> to traverse elements of an HTML
>
> document, methods, event handling, animations, and AJAX for rapid
> development.
>
> *Chapter 15*, *AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand Framework*, is where
> we conclude this book by finishing the external library section.
> Angular has been one of the most popular frameworks since it was
> introduced by Google. We will look at all the main concepts that you
> will need to begin writing applications with Angular.

## What you need for this book

> *Preface*
>
> Most likely, for this book, you will need nothing that you are not
> already using! You will need a computer, a browser, and a text editor.
> Each chapter will cover different concepts and languages, so there may
> be differences between each chapter.
>
> Here is a summary of the various things you will need throughout the
> chapters:

-   For Chapters 1-5, you will only need a text editor and a browser.

-   For Chapters 6-11, you will need the same text editor and browser,
    but with JavaScript being a programming language, I would recommend
    an integrated development environment (IDE). JetBrains makes a great
    IDE called WebStorm for web development. However, this is not
    necessarily needed for these chapters.

-   For Chapters 12-14, you will again need a text editor and browser.
    An IDE would also be very helpful for this section. Anytime you are
    dealing with complex frameworks, an IDE will make your life easier.

> Although you can just use a notepad and a browser to do any sort of
> development, an IDE is always preferred and suggested for development
> in any specific language. I would suggest using Adobe Dreamweaver for
> beginners. The intellisense of
>
> IDE makes it a lot easier to code as it auto-suggests various methods,
> names, and variables, so you don\'t have to remember everything. As we
> will be dealing with the elements and document nodes in the JQuery
> section, you should have extensions enabled in your browser. ECMA
> Script 6 is very recent and not fully supported by all browsers. In
> some examples, you might have to load ES6 compilers to enable that
>
> feature in your browser. However, I would highly recommend that you
> use the latest version of Google Chrome as a client, as it covers most
> of the sections in ES6.

## Who this book is for

> This book is intended for beginners as well as advanced web
> developers. This book will be a valuable resource for anyone who is a
> web developer. You can look up any concept that deals with HTML, CSS,
> JavaScript, NodeJS, Bootstrap, jQuery, or Angular in this book.

# HTML Elements

> **HyperText Markup Language** (**HTML**) is a language that annotates
> text. Annotation of text is done using elements. Using the following p
> element, as an example, we will see how to use HTML:
>
> \<p\>This is an example\</p\>
>
> HTML elements also have attributes that will modify how they are
> rendered or interpreted. Attributes are added inside of the starting
> tag. Here is the class attribute in a div element:
>
> \<div class=\"example\"\>This is an example\</div\>
>
> There have been multiple specifications of HTML so far, but we will
> just look at the most commonly used and important elements of HTML5.
> HTML5 is the latest official specification, so we will be as
> future-proof as possible at the time of writing this book. You will
> want to follow the specifications of HTML as closely as possible. Most
> browsers are very forgiving and will render your HTML, but when you go
> beyond the specifications, you can and will run into strange rendering
> issues.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image9.png){width="0.4178423009623797in"
> height="0.3365758967629046in"}All HTML elements will have global
> attributes. The attributes listed for each element in the sections
> that follow are the attributes beyond the global attributes.

## DOCTYPE

> The DOCTYPE element defines the document type of the file, as follows:
>
> \<!DOCTYPE documentType\>
>
> []{#_bookmark2 .anchor}*[HTML Elements]{.underline}*

### Attributes

> The documentType attribute that you can see in the preceding code lets
> the browser know the type of document you will use.

### Description

> HTML5 has a simple document type declaration, \<!DOCTYPE html\>. This
> lets the browser know that the document is HTML5. The previous
> versions of HTML needed a formal definition of the version being used,
> but HTML5 has removed this for simplicity.
>
> Most browsers will enforce strict adherence to the document type
> declared and try and figure out what it is based on looking at the
> document. This can lead to rendering issues, so it is recommended that
> you do follow the standards.
>
> Here is an HTML5 declaration:
>
> \<!DOCTYPE html\>

## html {#html-1}

> The html element is the root element of the HTML document:
>
> \<html manifest\>\</html\>

### Attributes

> The manifest attribute links to a resource manifest that lists which
> files should be
>
> cached.

### Description

> The html element must directly follow the DOCTYPE element. This is the
> root element that all other elements must be descendants of.
>
> The html element must have one head element and one body element as
> its children. All other elements will be inside these tags.

[]{#_bookmark3 .anchor}*Chapter 1*

> Here is what a simple HTML page looks like:
>
> \<!DOCTYPE html\>
>
> \<html manifest=\"offline.appcache\"\>\<head\>
>
> \</head\>
>
> \<body\>
>
> Hey
>
> \</body\>
>
> \</html\>

## Document metadata

> The next elements will give metadata about the document. In addition
> to this, you can also include links to resources, such as CSS and
> JavaScript.

### head {#head-1}

> The head element is the metadata parent element. All other metadata
> elements will be children of this element:
>
> \<head\>\</head\>

#### Description

> The head element usually must have a title element inside it. The
> elements that can go in head are title, link, meta, style, script,
> noscript, and base. These elements are explained next.
>
> Here is an example of the head element that defines a title and
> stylesheet
>
> element:
>
> \<head\>
>
> \<title\>Title that appears as the tab name\</title\>
>
> \<link href=\"style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"
> media=\"all\" /\>
>
> \</head\>

#### title

> The title element displays the title of the document. This is what is
> displayed in the browser\'s tab or the browser window:
>
> \<title\>\</title\>
>
> []{#_bookmark4 .anchor}*[HTML Elements]{.underline}*

##### Description

> The title element is an aptly named element. This is a required
> element in head, and there should only be one title element for a
> document. Here is a simple example of title element:
>
> \<head\>
>
> \<title\>Example\</title\>
>
> \</head\>

#### link

> The link element links a resource to the current document:
>
> \<link crossorigin href media rel sizes type\>\</link\>

##### Attributes

> The attributes that are used in the link element are as follows:

-   crossorigin: This tells the browser whether to make the
    **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing** (**CORS**) request or not

-   href: This indicates the URL of the resource

-   media: This selects the media that this resource applies to

-   rel: This indicates the relationship of this resource to the
    document

-   sizes: This is used with rel when it is set to icons

-   type: This indicates the type of content of the resource

##### Description

> The link element has a lot of attributes, but most of the time, it is
> used for loading the CSS resources. This means that you will want to
> use the attributes href, rel, type, and media at least.
>
> You can have multiple link elements in a head element. Here is a
> simple example of how to load CSS:
>
> \<link href=\"style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"
> media=\"all\" /\>
>
> \<link href=\"style.css\" media=\"screen\" rel=\"styleshhet\" sizes
> type=\"text/css\"\>\</link\>

##### See also

> You can also refer to the crossorigin, href, media, rel, sizes, and
> type attributes
>
> to find out more details about the title element.

#### meta

> *Chapter 1*
>
> The meta element contains metadata about the document. The syntax is
> as follows:
>
> \<meta content http-equiv name\>\</meta\>

##### Attributes

> The attributes that are used in the meta element are as follows:

-   content: This states the value of either the name or http-equiv
    attribute.

-   http-equiv: This attribute, in the case of HTML5, can be set to
    default- style, which sets the default style. Alternatively, it can
    be set to refresh, which can specify the number of seconds taken to
    refresh the page

> and a different URL for the new page if needed, for example, http-
> [equiv=\"1;url=http://www.google.com\"](http://www.google.com/).

-   name: This states the name of the metadata.

##### Description

> The meta tag has many nonstandard applications. The standardized
> applications can be viewed in *Chapter 2*, *HTML Attributes*.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image10.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.33658683289588803in"}Apple has many meta tags that will pass
> information to an iOS device. You can set a reference to an App Store
> application, set an icon, or display the page in the full screen mode,
> as just a few examples. All of these tags are nonstandard, but useful
> when targeting iOS devices. This is true for many other sites and
> companies.
>
> You can use multiple meta tags in a head element. Here are two
> examples. The first example will refresh the page every 5 seconds and
> the other will define the author metadata:
>
> \<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"5\" /\>
>
> \<meta name=\"author\" content=\"Joshua\" /\>

##### See also

> You can also refer to the name attribute to find out more details
> about the meta
>
> element.
>
> []{#_bookmark6 .anchor}*[HTML Elements]{.underline}*

#### style

> The style element contains the style information.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> \<style media scoped type\>\</style\>

##### Attributes

> The attributes that are used in the style element are as follows:

-   media: This is a media query

-   scoped: The styles contained in this element only apply to the
    parent element

-   type: This sets the type of document; the default value is text/css

##### Description

> The style element is usually in the head element. This allows you to
> define CSS
>
> styles for the current document.
>
> The preferred method of using CSS is to create a separate resource and
> use the link element. This allows styles to be defined once and used
> everywhere on a website instead of defining them on every page. This
> is a best practice as it allows us to define the styles in one spot.
> We can then easily find and change styles.
>
> Here is a simple inline stylesheet that sets the font color to blue:
>
> \<style media=\"screen\" scoped type=\"text/css\"\> body{
>
> color: #0000FF;
>
> }
>
> \</style\>

##### See also

> You can also refer to the global attributes and Chapters 3-7 to know
> more details about the style element.

#### base

> The base element is the base URL for the document. The syntax is as
> follows:
>
> \<base href target\>

[]{#_bookmark7 .anchor}*Chapter 1*

##### Attributes

> The attributes that are used in the base element are as follows:

-   href: This indicates the URL to be used as the base URL

-   target: This indicates the default target to be used with the URL

##### Description

> The base URL is used whenever a relative path or URL is used on a
> page. If this is not set, the browser will use the current URL as the
> base URL.
>
> Here is an example of how to set the base URL:
>
> \<base [href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/\"\>](http://www.packtpub.com/)

##### See also

> You can also refer to the target attribute to find out more details
> about the base
>
> element.

#### script

> The script element allows you to reference or create a script for the
> document:
>
> \<script async crossorigin defer src type\>\<script\>

##### Attributes

> The attributes that are used in the script element are as follows:

-   async: This is a Boolean attribute that tells the browser to process
    this script asynchronously. This only applies to the referenced
    scripts.

-   crossorigin: This tells the browser whether to make a CORS request
    or not.

-   defer: This is a Boolean attribute that tells the browser to execute
    the script after the document has been parsed.

-   src: This distinguishes the URL of the script.

-   type: This defines the type of the script that defaults to
    JavaScript if the attribute is omitted.

> []{#_bookmark8 .anchor}*[HTML Elements]{.underline}*

##### Description

> The script element is the way to get JavaScript into your document and
> add enhanced interactivity. This can be done using a bare script tag
> and adding JavaScript into the element. Also, you can use the src
> attribute to reference an external script. It is considered a best
> practice to reference a script file as it can be reused here.
>
> This element can be a child of head or can be placed anywhere in the
> body of the document. Depending on where the script element is
> located, you may or may not have access to the DOM.
>
> Here are two examples of using a script element. The first example
> will reference an external script, the second will be an inline script
> element, and the last will show how to use the crossorigin attribute:
>
> \<script src=\"example.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"\>\</script\>
>
> \<script\>
>
> var a = 123;
>
> \</script\>
>
> \<script async crossorigin=\"anonymous\" defer src=\"application.js\"
> type=\"text/javascript\"\>\<script\>

#### noscript

> The noscript element will be parsed if scripting is turned off in the
> browser. The syntax is as follows:
>
> \<noscript\>\</noscript\>

##### Description

> If scripting is enabled, the content inside of this element will not
> appear on the page and the code inside it will run. If scripting is
> disabled, it will be parsed.
>
> This element is mainly used to let the user know that the site may not
> work with JavaScript. Almost every website today not only uses
> JavaScript, but requires it.
>
> Here is an example of the noscript element:
>
> \<noscript\>
>
> Please enable JavaScript.
>
> \</noscript\>

[]{#_bookmark9 .anchor}*Chapter 1*

## Semantic content sections

> The next elements are the main elements to use when adding content to
> the
>
> document. For example, using the article element instead of an
> arbitrary div element allows the browser to infer that this is the
> main content of the page. These elements should be used to give
> structure to a document and not be used for styling purposes. Semantic
> elements make our HTML document more accessible using an
> ever-increasing amount of different devices.

### body {#body-1}

> The body element is the main content section of the document. There
> must be only one main element, its syntax is as follows:
>
> \<body\>\</body\>

#### Attributes

> The attributes of the body element include the inline event
> attributes.

#### Description

> The body element is the main content section of most documents. It
> must be the second child element of html, and there should only be one
> body element in a document.
>
> Here is an example of the body element:
>
> \<body\>
>
> \<span\>Example Body\</span\>
>
> \</body\>

### section {#section-1}

> The section element describes the content section of a document. For
> example, this can be a chapter of a book:
>
> \<section\>\</section\>
>
> []{#_bookmark10 .anchor}*[HTML Elements]{.underline}*

#### Description

> The section element is a new element that was introduced in HTML5. A
> section element should group the content together. While not a
> requirement, using a heading element as the first element in the code
> is a best practice. The section should be viewed as another part of
> the outline of the document. It groups related items into an easily
> targeted area. You can use this element multiple times in a document.
>
> Here is an example of the section element:
>
> \<section\>
>
> \<h2\>Section Heading\</h2\>
>
> \<p\>Section content.\</p\>
>
> \</section\>

### nav {#nav-1}

> The nav element is the navigation element:
>
> \<nav\>\</nav\>

#### Description

> The nav element is another semantic element introduced with HTML5.
> This lets the browser know that the content of this element is the
> parent and is for navigation.
>
> The nav element enhances accessibility by giving screen readers a
> landmark for navigation. This element should wrap any site navigation
> or other links that are grouped together for ease of navigation. You
> can use this multiple times.
>
> Here is an example of using the nav element:
>
> \<nav\>
>
> \<ul\>
>
> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>Home\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \</ul\>
>
> \</nav\>

#### article

> The article element is designed to wrap content that can stand on its
> own:
>
> \<article\>\</article\>

#### Description

> *Chapter 1*
>
> The article element is a new element introduced in HTML5. The article
> element is similar to the section element; in that, it denotes that
> the content in the element is the core part of the page. The article
> element should be a complete composition that can stand on its own.
> For example, in a blog, the actual blog post should be wrapped with an
> article element.
>
> Content can then be further broken down using either an article
> element or a section element. There is no standard rule for when to
> use either. However, both should be related to the content in the
> outer article element.
>
> Here is an example of the article element being used:
>
> \<article\>
>
> \<header\>
>
> \<h1\>Blog Post\</h1\>
>
> \</header\>
>
> \<p\>This post covers how to use an article element\...\</p\>
>
> \<footer\>
>
> \<address\>
>
> Contact the author, Joshua
>
> \</address\>
>
> \<footer\>
>
> \</article\>

### Headings

> The heading elements are the elements that specify different levels of
> headings according to their importance:
>
> \<h1\>\</h1\>
>
> \<h2\>\</h2\>
>
> \<h3\>\</h3\>
>
> \<h4\>\</h4\>
>
> \<h5\>\</h5\>
>
> \<h6\>\</h6\>

#### Description

> These should be used to give relative importance to different
> headings. For example, h1 should be used for the title of the
> document. The importance of a heading goes down as the heading value
> goes up, that is, h6 is the least important level of heading in the
> example that follows.
>
> []{#_bookmark12 .anchor}*[HTML Elements]{.underline}*
>
> Here is an example using all the headings:
>
> \<h1\>Heading Importance 1\</h1\>

    lowercase Roman numerals (i), and uppercase Roman numerals (I).

#### Description

### figure {#figure-1}

> The syntax of the figure element is as follows:
>
> \<figure\>\</figure\>

#### Description

> The figure element is a new element introduced with HTML5. In much the
> same way as an article adds some meaning where there was none, a

> the semantic meaning of the document. It should only be used when no
> other element suits your requirements.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> \<div\>
>
> You can put whatever you want in here!

>
> Here is an example of the main element in use:
>
> \<main\>
>
> This is the main content of the document.

>
> []{#_bookmark23 .anchor}The link can be that of an anchor tag in the
> document, a relative URL, or any
>

### img {#img-1}

> The img element is the image element:
>
> \<img alt crossorigin height ismap sizes src srcset width /\>

[]{#_bookmark31 .anchor}*Chapter 1*

#### Attributes

> The attributes that are used in the img element are as follows:

-   alt: This is the alternate text for the image. Use this to describe
    the image. This is used to enhance accessibility.

-   crossorigin: This lets the browser know whether this image should be
    fetched with a CORS request. If the image will be modified in a
    canvas element and not from the same domain name, then a CORS
    request must be used.

-   height: This is an attribute to set the height of the image.

-   ismap: This lets the browser know whether the image is used in a
    server-side map.

-   sizes: This is a list of media conditions that will map to a size.
    This is used to help the browser determine which image to use. By
    default, this will be 100 VW, which is 100% of the view width.

-   src: This is the most important attribute, it is the image URL.

-   srcset: This is a list of multiple images that can be used for
    display on our web page. This is used to target different screen
    sizes or pixel densities.

-   width: This is an attribute to set the width of the image.

#### Description

> The img element is used if you want an image in the document. This
> element has many attributes, but the src and alt attributes are the
> only required attributes. The alt attribute should be used to describe
> the image in almost 100% of the cases. The main exception is when the
> image is only used as a decorative image, for example, when an image
> is used instead of a horizontal rule. The width and height can be used
> if the image is of a different size than what is needed on the page;
> otherwise, it defaults to the size of the image.
>
> The crossorigin element can be confusing. It is used to ensure that
> you have ownership of an image before you modify the image in a canvas
> element. The image needs to either be from the same fully qualified
> domain name or the server\'s response must let the browser know
> whether the current domain can use the image.
>
> Finally, srcset is used to give the browser a list of images that it
> can use. This is done with a comma-separated list of URLs and a
> descriptor. A descriptor can either be a width descriptor, which would
> be a number followed by w, or a pixel descriptor, which is a number
> followed by x. The width descriptor tells the browser the width of the
> image. The pixel descriptor tells the browser the pixel density it
> should use for the image.
>
> []{#_bookmark32 .anchor}*[HTML Elements]{.underline}*
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image11.png){width="0.41784120734908137in"
> height="0.33658683289588803in"}The width descriptor can also be used
> by the browser when the pixel density changes. For example, if you
> have an image that is double the resolution and the pixel density
> doubles as well, the browser will choose the larger resolution.
>

> document. This gives you a lot of flexibility with two-dimensional
> drawings that images do not give you.
>
> Here is an example that demonstrates the difference between height,
> width, and viewport. The viewport takes up the bounds of the element,
> and height and width give the element its size:
>

> attributes. The attributes can change how the browser renders the
> element, configures it, and the behavior involving the element.
>
> The focus of the chapter will be entirely on attributes. If you are
> unsure about which attributes apply to which elements, the previous
> chapter goes over almost all the elements and the attributes that
> apply to them.

> However, you should note that just because the attribute is available,
> it does not mean that it will actually do anything.

> of values you can use. The first is a negative number. This defines
> that it is not in the list of elements for tab order. A zero value
> means that the browser should determine the order of this element.
> This is usually the order in which the elements occur in the document.
> This is a positive number and it will set the tab order.
>
> The following example demonstrates that you can set tabindex in a
> different order to where the elements are in the document:

# CSS Concepts and

Applications

> **Cascading Style Sheet** (**CSS**) is the preferred way to style
> HTML. HTML has a style element and a global style attribute. These
> make it very easy to write unmaintainable HTML. For example, let\'s
> imagine that we have 10 elements on an HTML page for which we want the
> font color to be red. We create a span element to wrap the text that
> has the font color red, as follows:
>
> \<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"\>\</span\>
>
> Later, if we decide to change the color to blue, we will have to
> change 10 instances of that element and then multiply this by the
> number of pages we have used the span element on. This is completely
> unmaintainable.
>
> This is where CSS comes in. We can target specific elements/groups of
> elements to which we wish to apply a specific style. CSS allows us to
> define these styles, easily update them, and change them from one
> place to another.
>
> This book will focus on the most used CSS selectors, units, rules,
> functions, and properties from CSS1, CSS2.1, and CSS3. For the most
> part, these should all work in any browser, but there are exceptions.
> A great rule of thumb is that newer browsers will have fewer issues.
>
> We will get started with a quick overview of the different types of
> basic selectors.
>
> []{#_bookmark89 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*

## Basic selectors

> A selector represents a structure. This representation is then used in
> a CSS rule to determine what elements are selected to be styled by
> this rule. CSS style rules apply in the form of a waterfall effect.
> Each rule that is matched is also passed on to each of its children,
> matched and applied based on the weight of the selector. This section
> will only focus on the most basic of selectors.
>
> The basic selectors are either type selectors, universal selectors,
> attribute selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, or pseudo-classes.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image15.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365758967629046in"}All CSS selectors are case-insensitive.
> Selectors can also be grouped together to share rules. To group
> selectors, you just have to split them with commas. Consider the
> following example:
>
> p { color: #ffffff; } article { color: #ffffff }
>
> Here, the following is the same as the preceding declaration
>
> p, article { color: #ffffff }

### The simple selector

> The following selectors are all the simple selectors for CSS.

### The type selectors

> The type selectors selects based on the element name:
>
> E
>
> ns\|E
>
> Here, E is the element name and ns is a namespace.

#### Description

> This is the simplest way to select elements---using their name. For
> the most part, when using just HTML, you not need to worry about the
> namespace, as all of the HTML elements are in the default namespace.
> An asterisk can be used to specify all namespaces, for example,
> \*\|Element.

[]{#_bookmark90 .anchor}*Chapter 3*

> When this selector is used, it will match all of the elements in the
> document. For example, if you have fifteen h2 elements and use a
> single h2 element, then this rule will match all fifteen.
>
> Here are a few examples of the type selector. The first code sets all
> the h1 elements\' font color to red. The next code applies red as the
> background color for all p elements:
>
> h1 { color: #ff0000; }
>
> p { background: #ff0000; }

### The universal selector

> The asterisk (\*) represents any and all qualified elements:
>
> \* ns\|\*
>
> \*\|\*
>
> Here, ns is a namespace.

#### Description

> This is essentially a wildcard selector. It will match every element.
> This is true even when used with other selectors. For example,
> \*.my-class and .my-class are the same.
>
> While you can use it as a single selector to match every element, it
> is most useful when used with other selectors. Following along with
> our preceding example, we may want to select any element that is a
> descendant of an article element. This selector is very explicit and
> easy to read, take a look at the following syntax:
>
> article \*
>
> Here is an example. The first example uses attribute selectors to
> select any elements with hreflang in English, and the second example
> will select all elements in the document:
>
> \*\[hreflang=\"en\"\] { display: block;
> background:url(flag_of_the_UK); }
>
> \* { padding: 0; }
>
> []{#_bookmark91 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*

### The attribute selectors

> These selectors will match against attributes of an element. There are
> seven different types of attribute selector and they are as follows:
>
> \[attribute\] \[attribute=value\] \[attribute\~=value\]
> \[attribute\|=value\] \[attribute\^=value\] \[attribute\$=value\]
> \[attribute\*=value\]
>
> These selectors are usually preceded by a type selector or universal
> selector.

#### Description

> This selector is a way to use a regular expression syntax in a
> selector rule. Each of the selectors will act differently based on the
> use, so they are listed with the differences here:

-   \[attribute\]: This matches an element that has the \[attribute\]
    attribute, irrespective of the value of the attribute.

-   \[=\]: The value has to be an exact match.

-   \[\~=\]: This is used when the attribute takes a list of values. One
    of the values in the list must match.

-   \[\|=\]: This attribute must either be an exact match or the value
    must begin with the value followed immediately by a -.

-   \[\^=\]: This attribute matches the value that has this prefix.

-   \[\$=\]: This attribute matches the value that has this suffix.

-   \[\*=\]: This attribute matches any substring of the value.

> The best way to really show the difference between these is to use
> some examples. We will look at the lang and href attributes. The
> examples will be in the same order in which they were introduced.

[]{#_bookmark92 .anchor}*Chapter 3*

> Here is the HTML file that the examples will be selecting.
>
> \<span lang=\"en-us en-gb\"\>Attribute Selector\</span\>
>
> \<span lang=\"es\"\>selector de atributo\</span\>
>
> \<span lang=\"de-at de\"\>German (Austria)\</span\>
>
> \<a href=\"https://example.com\"\>HTTPS\</a\>
>
> \<a [href=\"http://google.com\"\>Google\</a\>](http://google.com/)
>
> \<a
> [href=\"http://example.com/example.pdf\"\>Example](http://example.com/example.pdf)
> PDF\</a\>
>
> Using the following, we should have all the spans with a lang
> attribute with a black background, Spanish will be grey, German will
> be red, English will be blue, anchor elements that have https
> attribute will be yellow, any PDFs will be red, and any anchor to
> Google will be green. Here are the preceding styles described:
>
> span\[lang\] { background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff; }
> span\[lang=\"es\"\] { color: #808080; }
>
> span\[lang\~=\"de-at\"\] { color: #ff0000; } span\[lang\|=\"en\"\] {
> color: #0000ff; } a\[href\^=\"https\"\] { color: #ffff00; }
> a\[href\$=\"pdf\"\] { color: #ff0000; } a\[href\*=\"google\"\] {
> color: #00ff00; }

### The class selectors

> This selector will match the HTML elements based on the class
> attribute of the element.
>
> element.class
>
> .class or \*.class element.class.another-class

#### Description

> This is the most commonly used selector. Selecting based on the class
> attribute allows you to style elements in an orthogonal manner.
> Classes can be applied to many different elements and we can style
> each of those elements in the same manner.
>
> The class selector can be stacked so that both classes will have to be
> present.
>
> []{#_bookmark93 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*
>
> Here is some HTML with different elements that have a class attribute:
>
> \<h1 class=\"red\"\>Red Text\</h1\>
>
> \<span class=\"red\"\>Red Text\</span\>
>
> \<span class=\"green black\"\>Green text, black background\</span\>
>
> \<span class=\"green\"\>Normal text\</span\>
>
> Here is the CSS to style the HTML:
>
> .red { color: #ff0000; }
>
> .green.black { color: #00ff00; background-color: #000000; }
>
> When the red class is applied to an element, it will change the color
> of the text to red. The compound green and black will only select
> elements that have both classes defined.

### The ID selectors

> This selector will match based on the ID attribute of the element:
>
> #id
>
> element#id or \*#id

#### Description

> The ID attribute should be unique for the document, so the ID selector
> should only ever target one element. This is in contrast to the class
> selector, which can be used to select multiple elements. As an
> example, you can use a class selector to make every image on your page
> have a certain amount of margin and have a rule that specifically
> targets just your logo to have a different amount of margin.
>
> Here is an example CSS rule that targets an ID of a logo:
>
> #logo { margin: 10px; }

## Combinators

> Combinators are used to select more complex structures. They can help
> target
>
> specific elements or groups of elements that would be difficult to
> target otherwise.

### Descendant combinator

> This selector specifies that an element must be contained by another
> element.
>
> The combinator is the whitespace character. We are explicitly defining
> it here
>
> so that it is clear:
>
> selector-a selector-b

#### Description

> The two or more statements used in this selector can be any valid
> selector statement. For example, the first could be a class selector
> followed by a type selector. The distance between the selectors does
> not matter. Each intermediate element will not have to be listed for
> the selector to work.
>
> The combinator can be stacked. Each statement will have a whitespace
> character around it. This list of selectors does not need to be all
> inclusive, but for the selector to match the hierarchy, it does need
> to exist.
>
> This selector is best used when you only want to style elements in
> certain situations. The following example highlights this.
>
> In this first example, we will target images that are in an ordered
> list with the ID of
>
> presidents and give them a red border. Here is its HTML code:
>
> \<ol id=\"presidents\"\>
>
> \<li\>\<img src=\"pres01.png\" alt=\"PortraitProtrait of George
> Washington\" /\>George Washington\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\<img src=\"pres02.png\" alt=\"PortraitProtrait of John Adams\"
>
> /\>John Adams\</li\>
>
> \</ol\>
>
> \<img src=\"not_pres.png\" alt=\"not a President - no border\" /\>
>
> Here is the CSS rule:
>
> ol#presidents img { border: 1px solid #ff0000; }
>
> []{#_bookmark95 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*
>
> Here is an example that demonstrates that there can be many elements
> between selectors. Here is the very arbitrary HTML.
>
> \<div class=\"example\"\> I am normal.
>
> \<div\>
>
> \<div class=\"select-me\"\> I am red.
>
> \<span class=\"select-me\"\>I am red as well.\</span\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> Here is the CSS rule:
>
> .example .select-me { color: #ff0000; }
>
> Finally, here is an example of a multiple selector hierarchy, which
> has the following HTML:
>
> \<div class=\"first\"\>Not the target
>
> \<div class=\"second\"\>Not the target
>
> \<div class=\"third\"\>I am the target.\</div\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> The CSS rule:
>
> .first .second .third { color: #ff0000; }

### The child combinator

> This selector targets a specific child:
>
> element-a \> element-b

#### Description

> This is very similar to the descendant combinatory except for the fact
> that this only targets a child relationship. The second selector must
> be a direct descendant of the parent directly contained by the first.
>
> Here is an example that will only target the first span in this HTML:
>
> \<div\>Here is an \<span\>arbitrary\</span\>
>
> \<p\>\<span\>structure.\</span\>\</p\>\</div\>

[]{#_bookmark96 .anchor}*Chapter 3*

> Here is the CSS rule that only sets the first span\'s color to red:
>
> div \> span { color: #ff0000; }

### The adjacent sibling combinator

> This selector targets elements that are next to each other in the
> hierarchy:
>
> element-a + element-b

#### Description

> The two elements must have the same parent, and the first element must
> be
>
> immediately followed by the second.
>
> Here is an example that highlights how the selector works. Only the
> second span will have the rule applied. The final span\'s preceding
> sibling is not another span so it is not matched by the selector. Here
> is the HTML.
>
> \<p\>Here are a few spans in a row: \<span\>1\</span\>
> \<span\>2\</span\>
>
> \<em\>3\</em\> \<span\>4\</span\>\</p\>
>
> **CSS**:
>
> span + span { color: #ff0000; }

### The general sibling combinator

> This selector targets any element that has the same parent and follows
> the first:
>
> element-a \~ element-b

#### Description

> This is similar to the adjacent sibling combinatory; in that, both
> elements need the same parent. The difference is that the two elements
> can be separated by other elements.
>
> Here is an example that shows that both the second and third spans
> will be targeted even though there is an em element between them. Here
> is the HTML:
>
> \<p\>Here are a few spans in a row: \<span\>1\</span\>
> \<span\>2\</span\>
>
> \<em\>3\</em\> \<span\>4\</span\>\</p\>
>
> Here is the CSS rule:
>
> span \~ span { color: #ff0000; }
>
> []{#_bookmark97 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*

### The selector specificity

> This is not a selector rule like the others in this section. An
> element can be targeted by multiple rules, so how do you know which
> rule takes precedence? This is where specificity comes in. You can
> calculate which rule will be applied. Here is how it is calculated.
> Keep in mind that an inline style will trump any selector specificity:

-   The number of ID selectors in the selector is denoted by a

-   The number of class selectors, attribute selectors, and
    pseudo-classes in the selector is denoted by b

-   The number of type selectors and pseudo-elements in the selector is
    denoted by c

-   Any universal selectors are ignored

> The numbers are then concatenated together. The larger the value, the
> more precedence the rule has. Let\'s look at some selector examples.
> The examples will be composed of the selector and then the calculated
> value:

-   h1: a=0 b=0 c=1, 001 or 1

-   h1 span: a=0 b=0 c=2, 002 or 2

-   h1 p \> span: a=0 b=0 c=3, 003 or 3

-   h1 \*\[lang=\"en\"\]: a=0 b=1 c=1, 011 or 11

-   h1 p span.green: a=0 b=1 c=3, 013 or 13

-   h1 p.example span.green: a=0 b=2 c=3, 023 or 23

-   #title: a=1 b=0 c=0, 100

-   h1#title: a=1 b=0 c=1, 101

> The easiest way to think about this is that each grouping (a, b, or c)
> should be a smaller group of elements to choose from. This means that
> each step has more weight. For example, there can be many instances of
> h1 on a page. So, just selecting h1 is a little ambiguous. Next, we
> can add a class, attribute, or pseudo-class selector. This should be a
> subset of the instances of h1. Next, we can search by
>
> ID. This carries the most weight because there should only be one in
> the entire document.
>
> Here is an example HTML that has three headings:
>
> \<h1\>First Heading\</h1\>
>
> \<h1 class=\"headings\"\>\<span\>Second Heading\</span\>\</h1\>
>
> \<h1 class=\"headings\" id=\"third\"\>Third Heading\</h1\>

[]{#_bookmark98 .anchor}*Chapter 3*

> Here is the CSS rule that will target each heading differently. The
> first rule targets all the elements, but it has the lowest
> specificity, the next rule is in the middle, and the last rule only
> targets one element. In the following example, /\* \*/ denotes text
> that is a comment:
>
> h1 { color: #ff0000; } /\* 001 \*/
>
> h1.headings span { color: #00ff00; } /\* 012 \*/ h1#third { color:
> #0000ff; } /\* 101 \*/

## Pseudo-classes

> Pseudo-classes are selectors that use information that is outside of
> the document tree. The information that is not in the attributes of
> the element. This information can change between visits or even during
> the visit. Pseudo-classes always have a colon followed by the name of
> the pseudo-class.

### The link pseudo-classes

There are two mutually exclusive link pseudo-classes, namely, :link and
:visited.

#### :link

> This selects links that have not been visited. The syntax is as
> follows:
>
> :link

##### Description

> This pseudo-class exists on any anchor element that has not been
> visited. The browser may decide to switch a link back after some time.
>
> Here is an example along with the :visited pseudo-class. Here is its
> HTML:
>
> \<a href=\"#test\"\>Probably not visited\</a\>
>
> \<a
> [href=\"https://www.google.com\"\>Probably](http://www.google.com/)
> visited\</a\>
>
> Here is the CSS. We can make an assumption that you have visited
> Google, so the link would likely be green in color:
>
> a:link { color: #ff0000; } a:visited { color: #00ff00; }
>
> []{#_bookmark99 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*

#### :visited

> This selects links that have been visited. The syntax is as follows:
>
> :visited

##### Description

> This pseudo-class exists on any anchor element that has been visited.
> Here is an example along with the :link pseudo-class. Here is its
> HTML:
>
> \<a href=\"#test\"\>Probably not visited\</a\>
>
> \<a
> [href=\"https://www.google.com\"\>Probably](http://www.google.com/)
> visited\</a\>
>
> Here is the CSS. We can make the same assumption that you have visited
> Google, so
>
> the first link should be red and the second link will be green in
> color:
>
> a:link { color: #ff0000; } a:visited { color: #00ff00; }

### User action pseudo-classes

> These classes take effect based on actions of the user. These
> selectors are not mutually exclusive, and an element can have several
> matches at once.

#### :active

> This is used when the element is being activated:
>
> :active

##### Description

> The :active selector is most commonly used when the mouse button is
> pressed but not released. This style can be superseded by the other
> user actions or link pseudo-classes.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> \<a
> [href=\"https://www.google.com\"\>Google\</a\>](http://www.google.com/)
>
> The link will turn green while you are clicking on it. Here is its
> CSS:
>
> a:active { color: #00ff00; }

#### :focus

> *Chapter 3*
>
> This selector targets the element that has to be focused on. The
> syntax is as follows:
>
> :focus

##### Description

> An element is considered to have focus when it accepts keyboard input.
> For example, a text input element that you have either tabbed to or
> have clicked inside.
>
> Here is a text input example:
>
> \<input type=\"text\" value=\"Red when focused\"\>
>
> Here is the CSS. This also highlights the fact that you can use a
> pseudo-class, which allows use of more complex selectors:
>
> input\[type=\"text\"\]:focus { color: #ff0000; }

#### :hover

> This selector targets the elements when a user hovers their mouse over
> an element:
>
> :hover

##### Description

> This is used when a user has their cursor hovering over an element.
> Some browsers (a great example being mobile touch devices, such as
> mobile phones) may not implement this pseudo-class, as there is no way
> to determine whether a user is hovering over an element.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> \<span\>Hover over me!\</span\>
>
> The text in the span will be red in color when hovered over. Here is
> its CSS:
>
> span:hover { color: #ff0000; }

### The structural selectors

> These selectors allow you to select elements based on the document
> tree; this is very difficult or impossible to do with other selectors.
> This only selects nodes that are elements and does not include text
> that is not inside an element. The numbering is 1-based indexing.
>
> []{#_bookmark101 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*

### :first-child

> This targets an element that is the first child of another element:
>
> :first-child

#### Description

> This is the same as :nth-child(1). This selector is straightforward,
> the first child of
>
> the element type this is applied to will be selected.
>
> Here is an example that will only select the first paragraph element.
> Here is the
>
> HTML:
>
> \<p\>First paragraph.\</p\>
>
> \<p\>Second paragraph.\</p\>
>
> Here is the CSS. This will change the text of the first paragraph red:
>
> p:first-child { color: #ff0000; }

### :first-of-type

> This targets the first element type that is a child of another
> element:
>
> :first-of-type

#### Description

> The :first-of-type attribute is different from :first-child because it
> will not
>
> select the element unless it is the first child. This is the same as
> :nth-of-type(1).
>
> Here is an example that will target the first paragraph element even
> though it is not the first child. Here is the HTML:
>
> \<article\>
>
> \<h1\>Title of Article\</h1\>
>
> \<p\>First paragraph.\</p\>
>
> \<p\>Second paragraph.\</p\>
>
> \</article\>
>
> Here is the CSS:
>
> p:first-of-type { color: #ff0000; }

[]{#_bookmark102 .anchor}*Chapter 3*

### :last-child

> This targets an element that is the last child of another element:
>
> :last-child

#### Description

> This is the same as :nth-last-child(1). This selector is
> straightforward, the last child of the element type this is applied to
> will be selected.
>
> Here is an example that will only select the last paragraph element.
> Here is the HTML:
>
> \<p\>First paragraph.\</p\>
>
> \<p\>Second paragraph.\</p\>
>
> Here is the CSS. This will change the color of the second and first
> paragraph red. This selector works because even on the most basic of
> pages, the p element is a child of the body element:
>
> p:last-child { color: #ff0000; }

### :last-of-type

> This targets the last element type that is a child of another element:
>
> :last-of-type

#### Description

> The :last-of-type attribute is different from :last-child because it
> will not select the element unless it is the first last-child
> attribute. This is the same as :nth- last-of-type(1).
>
> Here is an example that will target the last paragraph element. Here
> is its HTML:
>
> \<article\>
>
> \<p\>First paragraph.\</p\>
>
> \<p\>Second paragraph.\</p\>
>
> \<a href=\"#\"\>A link\</a\>
>
> \</article\>
>
> Here is the CSS:
>
> p:last-of-type { color: #ff0000; }
>
> []{#_bookmark103 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*

### :nth-child()

> This will divide all of the child elements and select them based on
> where they exist:
>
> :nth-child(an+b)

#### Description

> This selector has a parameter that is very expressive in what you can
> select. This also means that it is more complex than most other CSS
> rules. Here is the technical
>
> specification of the parameter. This selects elements based on its
> preceding elements.
>
> The parameter can be split into two parts: part a Part b. The part a
> is an integer that is followed by the character n. Part b has an
> optional plus or minus sign followed by an integer. The parameter also
> accepts two keywords: even and odd. Consider *2n+1* for example.
>
> This is much easier to understand when you look at it this way. The
> first part, an, is what the children are divided by. The 2n value
> would make groups of two elements and 3n value would make groups of
> three elements, and so on. The next part +1 will then select that
> element in the grouping. *2n+1* would select every odd item row
> because it is targeting the first element in every grouping of two
> elements. *2n+0* or *2n+2* would select every even item row. The first
> part, part a, can be omitted, and then it would just select the *n*th
> child out of the entire group. For example, *:nth- child(5)* would
> only select the fifth child and no other.
>
> Table rows are a great example of using this selector, so we will
> target every odd row. Here is the HTML:
>
> \<table\>
>
> \<tr\>\<td\>First (will be red)\</td\>\</tr\>
>
> \<tr\>\<td\>Second\</td\>\</tr\>
>
> \<tr\>\<td\>Third (will be red)\</td\>\</tr\>
>
> \</table\>
>
> Here is the CSS:
>
> tr:nth-child(2n+1) { color: #ff0000; }

### :nth-last-child

> This will target the nth element from the end:
>
> :nth-last-child(an+b)

#### Description

> *Chapter 3*
>
> This selector counts the succeeding elements. The counting logic is
> the same as it is for :nth-child.
>
> Here is an example using a table. Here is the HTML:
>
> \<table\>
>
> \<tr\>\<td\>First\</td\>\</tr\>
>
> \<tr\>\<td\>Second\</td\>\</tr\>
>
> \<tr\>\<td\>Third\</td\>\</tr\>
>
> \<tr\>\<td\>Fourth\</td\>\</tr\>
>
> \</table\>
>
> The first CSS rule will change the color of every other row to red,
> but because it counts from the end, the first and third row will be
> selected. The second CSS rule will only target the last row:
>
> tr:nth-last-child(even) { color: #ff0000; } tr:nth-last-child(-n+1) {
> color: #ff0000; }

#### See also

> The previous section :nth-child.

### :nth-last-of-type and :nth-of-type

> This selects elements based on their type and where they exist in the
> document:
>
> :nth-last-of-type(an+b)
>
> :nth-of-type(an+b)

#### Description

> Like all the other *n*th selectors, this one uses the same logic as
> :nth-child. The difference nth-of-type being that :nth-last-of-type
> only groups by elements of the same type.
>
> Here is an example that uses paragraphs and spans:
>
> \<p\>First\</p\>
>
> \<span\>First Span\</span\>
>
> \<span\>Second Span\</span\>
>
> \<p\>Second\</p\>
>
> \<p\>Third\</p\>
>
> []{#_bookmark105 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*
>
> Here is the CSS. This rule will only target the paragraphs and make
> the odd ones red:
>
> p:nth-of-type(2n+1) { color: #ff0000; }

#### See also

> The previous section :nth-child.

### :only-child

> This targets an element that has no siblings:
>
> :only-child

#### Description

> This will match when the :only-child attribute is the only child of an
> element.
>
> Here is an example with two tables, where one has multiple rows and
> the other has only one:
>
> \<table\>
>
> \<tr\>\<td\>First\</td\>\</tr\>
>
> \<tr\>\<td\>Second\</td\>\</tr\>
>
> \<tr\>\<td\>Third\</td\>\</tr\>
>
> \</table\>
>
> \<table\>
>
> \<tr\>\<td\>Only\</td\>\</tr\>
>
> \</table\>
>
> Here is the CSS to target the only row in the second table:
>
> tr:only-child { color: #ff0000; }

### :only-of-type

> This targets when there is only one of this element:
>
> :only-of-type

#### Description

> This will only match when there are no other siblings of the same type
> under a parent element.

[]{#_bookmark106 .anchor}*Chapter 3*

> Here is an example that uses arbitrary divisions to create a structure
> where one paragraph element is the only one of its type. Here is the
> HTML:
>
> \<div\>
>
> \<p\>Only p.\</p\>
>
> \<div\>
>
> \<p\>Not the \</p\>
>
> \<p\>only one.\</p\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> Here is the CSS rule that will only target the first paragraph\'s
> element:
>
> p:only-of-type { color: #ff0000; }

## Validation

> These are pseudo-classes that can be used to target the state of input
> elements and more.

### :checked

> This attribute targets the checked radio button or checkbox:
>
> :checked

#### Description

> Any element that can be toggled on or off can use this selector. As of
> now, these are radio buttons, checkboxes, and options in a selective
> list.
>
> Here is an example with a checkbox and a label value:
>
> \<input type=\"checkbox\" checked value=\"check-value\" name=\"test\"
> /\>
>
> \<label for=\"test\"\>Check me out\</label\>
>
> Here is a CSS rule that will target the label only when the checkbox
> is checked:
>
> input:checked + label { color: #ff0000; }

### :default

> This targets the default element from many similar elements:
>
> :default
>
> []{#_bookmark107 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*

#### Description

> Use this selector to help define the default element from a group of
> elements.
>
> In a form, this would be the default button or the initially selected
> option from a
>
> select element.
>
> Here is an example using a form:
>
> \<form method=\"post\"\>
>
> \<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" /\>
>
> \<input type=\"reset\" value=\"Reset\" /\>
>
> \</form\>
>
> Here is the CSS. This will only target the submit input as it is the
> default:
>
> :default { color: #ff0000; }

### :disabled and :enabled

> These will target elements based on their enabled state:
>
> :disabled
>
> :enabled

#### Description

> There is a disabled attribute that is available on interactive
> elements. Using
>
> :disabled will target elements where the :disabled attribute is
> present and
>
> :enabled will do the opposite.
>
> Here is some HTML with two inputs out of which one is disabled:
>
> \<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" disabled/\>
>
> \<input type=\"reset\" value=\"Reset\" /\>
>
> Here is the CSS. The disabled input will have its text color set as
> red and the other as green:
>
> input:disabled { color: #ff0000; } input:enabled { color: #00ff00; }

### :empty

> This targets elements that have no children:
>
> :empty

[]{#_bookmark108 .anchor}*Chapter 3*

#### Description

> This targets nodes without any children. Children can be any other
> element
>
> including text nodes. This means that even one space will count as a
> child. However, comments will not count as children.
>
> Here is an example with three div tags. The first is empty, the next
> has text, and the final one has one space in it. Here is the HTML:
>
> \<div\>\</div\>
>
> \<div\>Not Empty\</div\>
>
> \<div\> \</div\>
>
> Here is the CSS. Only the first div will have a red background:
>
> div { height: 100px; width: 100px; background-color: #00ff00; }
> div:empty { background-color: #ff0000; }

### :in-range and :out-of-range

> These selectors target elements that have a range limitation:
>
> :in-range
>
> :out-of-range

#### Description

> Some elements now have range limitations that can be applied. When the
> value is outside of this range, the :out-of-range selector will target
> it, and when the value is within the range, :in-range will target it.
>
> Here is an example that uses an input that is the number type:
>
> \<input type=\"number\" min=\"1\" max=\"10\" value=\"11\" /\>
>
> \<input type=\"number\" min=\"1\" max=\"10\" value=\"5\" /\>
>
> Here is the CSS. The first input will have red text because it is
> beyond the maximum
>
> range and the second will have green text:
>
> :in-range {color: #00ff00; }
>
> :out-of-range { color: #ff0000; }
>
> []{#_bookmark109 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*

### :invalid and :valid

> The :invalid and :valid attribute targets an element based on the
> validity of the data:
>
> :invalid
>
> :valid

#### Description

> Certain input elements have data validity, a great example being the
> e-mail element. The selectors select based on whether the data is
> valid or not. You should note that some elements are always valid, for
> example, a text input, and some elements will never be targeted by
> these selectors, for example, a div tag.
>
> Here is an example with an e-mail input:
>
> \<input type=\"email\" [value=\"test@test.com\"](mailto:test@test.com)
> /\>
>
> \<input type=\"email\" value=\"not a valid email\" /\>
>
> Here is the CSS. The first input will be green as it is valid and the
> other will be red:
>
> :valid {color: #00ff00; }
>
> :invalid { color: #ff0000; }

### :not or negation

> The :not attribute negates a selector:
>
> :not(selector)

#### Description

> The :not parameter must be a simple selector and will target the
> elements where the
>
> :not parameter is not true. This selector does not add to specificity
> of the rule.
>
> Here is an example using paragraphs:
>
> \<p\>Targeted Element\</p\>
>
> \<p class=\"not-me\"\>Non targeted element\</p\>
>
> Here is the CSS. Only the first paragraph will be targeted:
>
> p:not(.not-me) {color: #ff0000; }

### :optional and :required

> *Chapter 3*
>
> The :optional and :required attributes target elements that are either
> optional or required, respectively.
>
> :optional
>
> :required

#### Description

> This is used for any input element that is required or optional.
>
> Here is an example that has two inputs---one that is required and one
> that is not:
>
> \<input type=\"text\" value=\"Required\" required /\>
>
> \<input type=\"text\" value=\"Optional\" /\>
>
> Here is the CSS. The required input will have red text and the

>
> :required { color: #ff0000; }
>
> :optional { color: #00ff00; }

### :lang() {#lang-2}

> The :lang() attribute targets based on the language:
>
> :lang(language)

#### Description

> This selector works differently to the attribute selector; in that,
> this will target all elements that are in a specific language even if
> they are not explicitly defined. The attribute selector will only
> target elements that have a lang attribute.
>
> Here is an example with a span element that does not have a lang
> attribute, but it is the child of the body which does:
>
> \<body lang=\"en-us\"\>
>
> \<span\>This is English.\</span\>
>
> \</body\>
>
> []{#_bookmark111 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*
>
> Here is the CSS. The first rule will match the element, but the second
> will not
>
> match anything:
>
> :lang(en) { color: #ff0000; } span\[lang\|=en\] { color: #00ff00; }

## Pseudo-elements

> These are selectors that go beyond what is specified in the document.
> The selectors
>
> select things that may not even be elements in the document.
> Pseudo-elements are not considered part of a simple selector. This
> means that you cannot use a
>
> pseudo-element as part of the :not() selector. Finally, only one
> pseudo-element can be present per selector.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image16.png){width="0.41783792650918633in"
> height="0.3365780839895013in"}Note that all of the pseudo-elements
> start with a double colon (::). This was introduced in CSS3 to help
> differentiate between pseudo-classes that have a single colon (:).
> This is important because in CSS2, pseudo- elements only had the
> single colon. For the most part, you should use the double colon.

### ::before and ::after

> These are used to insert generated content before or after the
> selected element:
>
> ::before
>
> ::after e

#### Description

> This will insert content into the document based on the selector.
> Whether the content is placed before or after the element targeted
> depends on the pseudo-element used. Refer to the *Generated content*
> section to see what you can insert.
>
> Here is an example that uses both ::before and ::after. This will
> create a turkey sandwich. Here is the HTML.
>
> \<p class=\"sandwich\"\>Turkey\</p\>
>
> Here is the CSS that will put a slice of bread before and after the
> turkey:
>
> p.sandwich::before, p.sandwich::after
>
> { content: \":Slice of Bread:\"; }

### ::first-letter

> This targets the first letter of an element:
>
> ::first-letter

#### Description

> This will select the first letter of an element as long as it does not
> have any other
>
> content before it, for example an img element before a character would
> make
>
> ::first-letter not select the first character. Any punctuation that
> either precedes or follows the first letter would be included with the
> first letter. This will select any character, including not just
> letters but also numbers.
>
> This only applies to block-like containers such as block, list-item,
> table-cell, table-caption, and inline-block elements.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image17.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.336576990376203in"}The ::first-letter pseudo-element will
> only match if the first letter is on the first formatted line. If
> there is a line break before the first letter appears, it will not be
> selected.
>
> Here is an example, which will not select the first letter:
>
> \<p\>\<br /\>First letter\</p\>
>
> Here is the CSS:
>
> p::first-letter { font-size: 2em; }
>
> Here is an example:
>
> \<p\>This is a long line of text that may or may not be broken up
> across lines.\</p\>
>
> Here is the CSS. The T in This will be two times the font size of all
> the other characters:
>
> p::first-letter { font-size: 2em; }

### ::first-line

> The ::first-line attribute targets the first line of an element:
>
> ::first-line
>
> []{#_bookmark113 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*

#### Description

> This will target the first formatted line of a block-like container
> such as a block box, inline-block, table-caption, or table-cell.
>
> Here is an example, with the following HTML:
>
> \<p\>This is a long line of text that may or may not be broken up
> across lines based on the width of the page and the width of the
> element it is in.\</p\>
>
> \<p\>This is the entire first line.\</p\>
>
> Here is the CSS. This will make the first line, whatever it may be,
> red:
>
> p::first-line { color: #ff0000; }

### ::selection

> This targets text highlighted by the user:
>
> ::selection

#### Description

> This pseudo-element allows you to style any text that is highlighted
> by the user. This pseudo-element does not exist in CSS3, but it is
> part of the next version. Most browsers will still honor this
> pseudo-element.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> \<p\>Highlight this to text.\</p\>
>
> Here is the CSS. When the text is selected, the text will be white on
> a red background:
>
> ::selection { color: #ffffff; background: #ff0000; }

## Generated content

> This is not a selector, but is used with the pseudo-elements ::before
> and ::after. There are only certain types of content that you can
> generate. Here is a rundown.

[]{#_bookmark114 .anchor}*Chapter 3*

### content {#content}

> This is the content that will be placed either before or after
> elements:
>
> content(none, \<string\>, \<uri\>, \<counter\>, open-quote,
> close-quote, no-open-quote, no-close-quote, attr(x))

#### Parameters

> Following are the parameters and their description:

-   none: This parameter does not generate any content

-   normal: This is the default parameter and is the same as none

-   \<string\>: This is any string text content

-   \<uri\>: This will map to a resource, for example, an image

-   \<counter\>: This can be used as either the counter() or counters()
    function to put a counter before or after each element

-   open-quote and close-quote: This is used with the quotes generated
    content property

-   no-open-quote and no-close-quote: This does not add content, but
    increments or decrements the nesting level of quotes

-   attr(x):This returns the value of the attribute of the element this
    is targeting

#### Description

> This property is used to add content to the document. The output is
> controlled by the value used. The values can be combined to create
> more complex content.
>
> A new line can be inserted with the characters \\A. Just remember that
> HTML will ignore a line break by default.
>
> Here are some examples. These will demonstrate how to use many of the
> content values:
>
> \<h1\>First\</h1\>
>
> \<h1\>Second\</h1\>
>
> \<h1 class=\"test\"\>Attribute\</h1\>
>
> \<h2\>Line Break\</h2\>
>
> \<blockquote\>Don\'t quote me on this.\</blockquote\>
>
> []{#_bookmark115 .anchor}*[CSS Concepts and Applications]{.underline}*
>
> Here is the CSS. The h1 elements will have the word \"chapter\" along
> with a number before each. The h2 element will have a line break in
> its content. Finally, the blockquote will have an opening quote and a
> closing quote:
>
> h1 { counter-increment: chapter; }
>
> h1::before { content: \"Chapter\" counter(chapter) \": \" attr(class)
>
> ; }
>
> h2::before { content: \"New\\A Line\"; white-space: pre; }
> blockquote::before { content: open-quote; } blockquote::after {
> content: close-quote; }

### Quotation marks

> Quotation marks specify which characters are used as open and close
> quotes:
>
> quotes: \[\<string\> \<string\>\]+

#### Parameters

> \<string\> \<string\>: These are pairs of characters that will
> represent an open and close quote. You can use this multiple times to
> create levels of quotes.

#### Description

> We can use this property to set which quotation marks are used. Here
> is an example that has a nested quote:
>
> \<blockquote\>Don\'t quote me \<blockquote\>on\</blockquote\>
> this.\</blockquote\>
>
> The quotation marks are completely arbitrary. Here is the CSS:

# CSS Properties -- Part 1

> CSS properties are characteristics of an element in a markup language
> (HTML, SVG, XML, and so on) that control their style and/or
> presentation. These characteristics are part of a constantly evolving
> standard from the W3C.
>
> A basic example of a CSS property is border-radius:
>
> input {
>
> **border-radius:** 100px;
>
> }
>
> There is an incredible number of CSS properties, and learning them all
> is virtually impossible. Adding more into this mix, there are CSS
> properties that need to be vendor prefixed (-webkit-, -moz-, -ms-, and
> so on), making this equation even more complex.
>
> Vendor prefixes are short pieces of CSS that are added to the
> beginning of the CSS property (and sometimes CSS values too). These
> pieces of code are directly related to either the company that makes
> the browser (the \"vendor\") or to the CSS engine of the browser.
>
> There are four major CSS prefixes: -webkit-, -moz-, -ms- and -o-. They
> are explained here:

-   -webkit-: This references Safari\'s engine, Webkit (Google Chrome
    and Opera used this engine in the past as well)

-   -moz-: This stands for Mozilla, who creates Firefox

-   -ms-: This stands for Microsoft, who creates Internet Explorer

-   -o-: This stands for Opera, but only targets old versions of the
    browser

> Google Chrome and Opera both support the -webkit- prefix. However,
> these two browsers do not use the Webkit engine anymore. Their engine
> is called Blink and is developed by Google.
>
> []{#_bookmark117 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*
>
> A basic example of a prefixed CSS property is column-gap:
>
> .column {
>
> **-webkit-column-gap:** 5px;
>
> **-moz-column-gap:** 5px; column-gap: 5px;
>
> }
>
> Knowing which CSS properties need to be prefixed is futile. That\'s
> why it\'s important to keep a constant eye on CanIUse.com. However,
> it\'s also important to automate the prefixing process with tools such
> as Autoprefixer or -prefix-free, or mixins in preprocessors, and so
> on.
>
> However, vendor prefixing isn\'t in the scope of the book, so the
> properties we\'ll discuss are absent of any vendor prefixes. If you
> want to learn more about vendor prefixes, you can visit **Mozilla
> Developer Network** (**MDN**) at
> [http://tiny.cc/](http://tiny.cc/mdn-vendor-prefixes)
> [mdn-vendor-prefixes](http://tiny.cc/mdn-vendor-prefixes).

> Let\'s get the CSS properties reference rolling.

## Animation

> Unlike the old days of Flash, where creating animations required
> third-party applications and plugins, today we can accomplish
> practically the same things with a lot less overhead, better
> performance, and greater scalability all through CSS only.
>
> Forget plugins and third-party software! All we need is a text editor,
> some imagination, and a bit of patience to wrap our heads around some
> of the animation concepts CSS brings to our plate.

### Base markup and CSS

> Before we dive into all the animation properties, we will use the
> following markup and animation structure as our base:

######## HTML: {#html-2}

> \<div class=\"element\"\>\</div\>
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { width: 300px; height: 300px;
>
> }

[]{#_bookmark118 .anchor}*Chapter 4*

> \@keyframes fadingColors { 0% {
>
> background: red;
>
> }
>
> 100% {
>
> background: black;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> In the examples, we will only see the .element rule since the HTML and
>
> \@keyframes fadingColors will remain the same.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image18.png){width="0.3199507874015748in"
> height="0.39963582677165355in"}The \@keyframes declaration block is a
> custom animation that can be applied to any element. When applied, the
> element\'s background will go from red to black.
>
> Ok, let\'s do this.
>
> **animation-name**
>
> The animation-name CSS property is the name of the \@keyframes at-rule
> that we want to execute, and it looks like this:
>
> animation-name: fadingColors;

##### Description

> In the HTML and CSS base example, our \@keyframes at-rule had an
> animation where the background color went from red to black. The name
> of that animation is fadingColors.
>
> So, we can call the animation like this:
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { width: 300px; height: 300px;
>
> **animation-name: fadingColors;**
>
> }
>
> This is a valid rule using the longhand. There are clearly no issues
> with it at all. The thing is that the animation won\'t run unless we
> add animation-duration to it.
>
> []{#_bookmark119 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*

#### animation-duration

> The animation-duration CSS property defines the amount of time the
> animation will take to complete a cycle, and it looks like this:
>
> animation-duration: 2s;

##### Description

> We can specify the units either in seconds using s or in milliseconds
> using ms. Specifying a unit is required. Specifying a value of 0s
> means that the animation should actually never run.
>
> However, since we do want our animation to run, we do the following:
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { width: 300px; height: 300px;
>
> animation-name: fadingColors;
>
> **animation-duration: 2s;**
>
> }
>
> As mentioned earlier, this will make a box go from its red background
> to black in 2
>
> seconds and then stop.

#### animation-iteration-count

> The animation-iteration-count CSS property defines the number of times
> the
>
> animation should be played, and it looks like this:
>
> animation-iteration-count: infinite;

##### Description

> Here are two values: infinite and a *number*, such as 1, 3, or 0.5.
> Negative numbers are not allowed.
>
> Add the following code to the prior example:
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { width: 300px; height: 300px;
>
> animation-name: fadingColors; animation-duration: 2s;
>
> **animation-iteration-count: infinite;**
>
> }

[]{#_bookmark120 .anchor}*Chapter 4*

> This will make a box go from its red background to black, start over
> again with the
>
> red background and go to black, infinitely.

#### animation-direction

> The animation-direction CSS property defines the direction in which
> the
>
> animation should play after the cycle, and it looks like this:
>
> animation-direction: alternate;

##### Description

> There are four values: normal, reverse, alternate, and
> alternate-reverse.

-   normal: This makes the animation play forward. This is the default
    value.

-   reverse: This makes the animation play backward.

-   alternate: This makes the animation play forward in the first cycle,
    then backward in the next cycle, then forward again, and so on. In
    addition, timing functions are affected, so if we have ease-out, it
    gets replaced by ease-in when played in reverse.

> We\'ll look at these timing functions in a minute.

-   alternate-reverse: This is the same thing as alternate, but the
    animation starts backward, from the end.

> In our current example, we have a continuous animation. However, the
> background color has a \"hard stop\" when going from black (end of the
> animation) to red (start of the animation).
>
> Let\'s create a more \"fluid\" animation by making the black
> background fade into red and then red into black without any hard
> stops. Basically, we are trying to create a \"pulse-like\" effect:
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { width: 300px; height: 300px;
>
> animation-name: fadingColors; animation-duration: 2s;
>
> animation-iteration-count: infinite;
>
> **animation-direction: alternate;**
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark121 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*

#### animation-delay

> The animation-delay CSS property allows us to define when exactly an
> animation should start. This means that as soon as the animation has
> been applied to an element, it will obey the delay before it starts
> running.
>
> It looks like this:
>
> animation-delay: 3s;

##### Description

> We can specify the units either in seconds using s or in milliseconds
> using ms. Specifying a unit is required.
>
> Negative values are allowed. Take into consideration that using
> negative values means that the animation should start right away, but
> it will start midway into the animation for the opposite amount of
> time as the negative value.
>
> Use negative values with caution.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { width: 300px; height: 300px;
>
> animation-name: fadingColors; animation-duration: 2s;
>
> animation-iteration-count: infinite; animation-direction: alternate;
> **animation-delay: 3s;**
>
> }
>
> This will make the animation start after 3 seconds have passed.

#### animation-fill-mode

> The animation-fill-mode CSS property defines which values are applied
> to an element before and after the animation. Basically, outside the
> time the animation is being executed.
>
> It looks like this:
>
> animation-fill-mode: none;

[]{#_bookmark122 .anchor}*Chapter 4*

##### Description

> There are four values: none, forwards, backwards, and both.

-   none: No styles are applied before or after the animation.

-   forwards: The animated element will retain the styles of the last
    keyframe. This the most used value.

-   backwards: The animated element will retain the styles of the first
    keyframe, and these styles will remain during the animation-delay
    period. This is very likely the least used value.

-   both: The animated element will retain the styles of the first
    keyframe before starting the animation and the styles of the last
    keyframe after the animation has finished. In many cases, this is
    almost the same as using forwards.

> The prior properties are better used in animations that have an end
> and stop. In our example, we\'re using a fading/pulsating animation,
> so the best property to use is none.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { width: 300px; height: 300px;
>
> animation-name: fadingColors; animation-duration: 2s;
>
> animation-iteration-count: infinite; animation-direction: alternate;
> animation-delay: 3s;
>
> **animation-fill-mode: none;**
>
> }

#### animation-play-state

> The animation-play-state CSS property defines whether an animation is
> running
>
> or paused, and it looks like this:
>
> animation-play-state: running;

##### Description

> There are two values: running and paused. These values are
> self-explanatory.
>
> []{#_bookmark123 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { width: 300px; height: 300px;

>
> **animation-play-state: running;**
>
> }
>
> In this case, defining animation-play-state as running is redundant,
> but I\'m listing it for purposes of the example.

#### animation-timing-function

> The animation-timing-function CSS property defines how an animation\'s
> speed
>
> should progress throughout its cycles, and it looks like this:
>
> animation-timing-function: ease-out;
>
> There are five predefined values, also known as easing functions, for
> the **Bézier** curve (we\'ll see what the Bézier curve is in a
> minute): ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, and linear.

##### ease

> The ease function sharply accelerates at the beginning and starts
> slowing down towards the middle of the cycle, and it looks like this:
>
> animation-timing-function: ease;

##### ease-in

> The ease-in function starts slowly accelerating until the animation
> sharply ends, and it looks like this:
>
> animation-timing-function: ease-in;

##### ease-out

> The ease-out function starts quickly and gradually slows down towards
> the end and it looks like this:
>
> animation-timing-function: ease-out;

##### ease-in-out

> *Chapter 4*
>
> The ease-in-out function starts slowly and it gets fast in the middle
> of the cycle. It then starts slowing down towards the end. And it
> looks like this:
>
> animation-timing-function:ease-in-out;

##### linear

> The linear function has constant speed. No accelerations of any kind
> happen. It looks like this:
>
> animation-timing-function: linear;
>
> Now, the easing functions are built on a curve named the Bézier curve
> and can be called using the cubic-bezier() function or the steps()
> function.

##### cubic-bezier()

> The cubic-bezier() function allows us to create custom acceleration
> curves. Most use cases can benefit from the already defined easing
> functions we just mentioned (ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out and
> linear), but if you\'re feeling adventurous, cubic-bezier() is your
> best bet.
>
> Here\'s what a Bézier curve looks like:

![](./images-ref/media/image19.png)

> []{#_bookmark125 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*

###### Parameters

> The cubic-bezier() function takes four parameters as follows:
>
> animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(**x1, y1, x2, y2**);
>
> X and Y represent the *x* and *y* axes. The numbers 1 and 2 after each
> axis represent the control points. 1 represents the control point
> starting on the lower left, and 2 represents the control point on the
> upper right.

###### Description

> Let\'s represent all five predefined easing functions with the
> cubic-bezier()
>
> function:

-   ease: animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(.25, .1, .25, 1);

-   ease-in: animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(.42, 0, 1, 1);

-   ease-out: animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, .58, 1);

-   ease-in-out: animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(.42, 0, .58,
    1);

-   linear: animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1);

> I\'m not sure about you, but I prefer to use the predefined values.
>
> Now, we can start tweaking and testing each value to the decimal, save
> it, and wait for the live refresh to do its thing. However, that\'s
> too much time wasted testing if you ask me.

> **animation-timing-function: ease-out;**
>
> }

##### steps()

> The steps() timing function isn\'t very widely used, but knowing how
> it works is a must if you\'re into CSS animations.
>
> It looks like this:
>
> animation-timing-function: steps(6);
>
> This function is very helpful when we want our animation to take a

>
> of steps.
>
> After adding a steps() function to our current example, it looks like

> animation-delay: 3s;
>
> animation-fill-mode: none; animation-play-state: running;
>
> **animation-timing-function: steps(6);**
>
> }
>
> This makes the box take six steps to fade from red to black and vice

>
> []{#_bookmark127 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*

###### Parameters

> There are two optional parameters that we can use with the steps()
> function: start
>
> and end.

-   start: This will make the animation run at the beginning of each
    step. This will make the animation start right away.

-   end: This will make the animation run at the end of each step. This
    is the default value if nothing is declared. This will give the
    animation a short delay before it starts.

-   step-start: This is the same thing as steps(1, start). It means that
    every change happens at the beginning of each interval.

-   step-end: This is the same thing as steps(1, end). It means that
    every change happens at the end of each interval.

#### animation

> The animation CSS property is the shorthand for animation-name,
> animation- duration, animation-timing-function, animation-delay,
> animation- iteration-count, animation-direction, animation-fill-mode,
> and animation- play-state.
>
> It looks like this:
>
> animation: fadingColors 2s;

##### Description

> For a simple animation to work, we need at least two properties:
> animation-name
>
> and animation-duration.
>
> If you feel overwhelmed by all these properties, relax. Let me break
> them down for you in simple bits.
>
> Using the animation longhand, the code would look like this:
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { width: 300px; height: 300px;
>
> **animation-name: fadingColors; animation-duration: 2s;**
>
> }
>
> Using the animation shorthand, which is the recommended syntax, the
> code would look like this:
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { width: 300px; height: 300px;
>
> **animation: fadingColors 2s;**
>
> }
>
> This will make a box go from its red background to black in 2 seconds,
> and then stop.

### Final CSS code

> Let\'s see how all the animation properties look in one final example
> showing both the longhand and shorthand styles.

[]{#_bookmark130 .anchor}*Chapter 4*

#### Longhand style

> .element { width: 300px; height: 300px;
>
> animation-name: fadingColors; animation-duration: 2s;
>
> animation-iteration-count: infinite; animation-direction: alternate;
> animation-delay: 3s;
>
> animation-fill-mode: none; animation-play-state: running;
>
> animation-timing-function: ease-out;
>
> }

#### Shorthand style

> .element { width: 300px; height: 300px;
>
> animation: fadingColors 2s infinite alternate 3s none running
> ease-out;
>
> }
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image22.png){width="0.31995188101487315in"
> height="0.3996489501312336in"}The animation-duration property will
> always be considered first rather than animation-delay. All other
> properties can appear in any order within the declaration.
>
> Here is a demo in **CodePen**: <http://tiny.cc/animation>

## Background

> The CSS background properties handle the display of background effects
> on HTML elements.

### background-attachment {#background-attachment-1}

> The background-attachment CSS property defines how the background of
> an
>
> element scrolls relative to its containing parent, and it looks like
> this:
>
> background-attachment: fixed;
>
> []{#_bookmark131 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*

#### Description

> There are three values: scroll, fixed, and local.

-   scroll: The background does not move within its container

-   fixed: The background stays fixed to the viewport, no matter what

-   local: The background scrolls within its container and the viewport

> **CSS**:
>
> .scroll {
>
> background-attachment: scroll;
>
> }
>
> .fixed {
>
> background-attachment: fixed;
>
> }
>
> .local {
>
> background-attachment: local;
>
> }
>
> Here is a demo in CodePen: <http://tiny.cc/css-background>

### background-blend-mode {#background-blend-mode-1}

> The background-blend-mode CSS property specifies how the background
> image of
>
> an element should blend with its background color, and it looks like
> this:
>
> background-blend-mode: multiply;

#### Description

> There are 18 possible blend mode values:

-   color: Hue and saturation from the top color prevail, but the
    luminosity of the bottom color is added. Gray levels are preserved.

-   color-burn: The final color is the result of taking the bottom color
    and inverting it, dividing the value by the top color, and then
    inverting that value.

-   color-dodge: The final color is the result of dividing the bottom
    color with the inverse of the top one.

-   darken: The final color is the result of taking the darkest value
    per color in each channel.

*Chapter 4*

-   difference: The final color is the result of taking the lighter
    color and subtracting the darker color of the background image and
    background color.

-   exclusion: The result is similar to the difference, but with lower
    contrast.

-   hard-light: If the bottom color is darker, then the result is
    multiply. However, if the bottom color is lighter, the result is
    screen.

-   hue: Takes the hue of the top color, and the saturation and
    luminosity of the bottom color.

-   inherit: The final color inherits the blend mode of its parent
    container.

-   initial: This is the default value without any blending.

-   lighten: The result is the lightest values per color from each
    channel.

-   luminosity: The result is the luminosity of the top color, and the
    hue and saturation of the bottom one.

-   multiply: Multiply the top and bottom colors. This is the same
    effect as printing the colors on a translucent film and laying them
    one on top of the other.

-   normal: The final color is the color on top, regardless of the color
    underneath it.

-   overlay: The final color is multiply if the bottom color is darker.
    And it would be screen if the bottom color is lighter.

-   saturation: The final color is the saturation of the top color plus
    the hue and luminosity of the bottom one.

-   screen: Invert both the top and bottom colors, multiply them, and
    then invert that final color.

-   soft-light: Same as hard-light attribute but softer, like pointing a
    diffused light on the final color.

> In the following example, we will declare two backgrounds, an image
> and a color, and then apply a blend mode to them:

######## CSS with longhand:

> .element { width: 500px; height: 500px;
>
> background-image: url(\'../images/image.jpg\'); background-color: red;
>
> **background-blend-mode: multiply;**
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark132 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*

######## CSS with shorthand:

> .element { width: 500px; height: 500px;
>
> background-image: url(**../images/image.jpg**) **red**;
> **background-blend-mode: multiply;**
>
> }
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image23.png){width="0.3199496937882765in"
> height="0.3996576990376203in"}Notice that in the second example, the
> path to the image is not inside quotes. The quotes, single \[\'\'\] or
> double \[\"\"\], are optional.
>
> CSS-Tricks has a great Pen showing all these blend modes. However, I
> forked it to improve a few things on it.
>

### background-clip {#background-clip-1}

> The background-clip CSS property helps define whether an element\'s
> background
>
> extends below its border or not, and it looks like this:
>
> background-clip: border-box;

#### Description

> There are four values: inherit, border-box, padding-box, and
> content-box.

##### inherit

> This takes the value from its parent element.

##### border-box

> This makes the background cover the entire container, including the
> border.

##### padding-box

> This makes the background extend only up to where the border starts.

##### content-box

> This works like border-box, but it will take into consideration any
> padding, thus creating a gap between the border and the background.

[]{#_bookmark133 .anchor}*Chapter 4*

> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> background-clip: border-box;
>
> }
>
> Here is a demo in CodePen: <http://tiny.cc/background-clip>

### background-color {#background-color-1}

> The background-color CSS property defines the solid background color
> of an
>
> element, and it looks like this:
>
> background-color: red;

#### Description

> Also, transparent is actually a color in CSS.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image24.png){width="0.31995188101487315in"
> height="0.3996402012248469in"}If we wanted to set a gradient
> background color, we\'d have to use the background-image property
> instead. This is because gradients are actually images.
>
> The color value can be defined using any of the following methods:

-   Named color

-   Hexadecimal

-   RGB and RGBa

-   HSL and HSLa

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Named Color\*/
>
> .element {
>
> background-color: red;
>
> }
>
> /\*HEX\*/
>
> .element {
>
> background-color: #f00;
>
> }
>
> /\*RGB\*/
>
> .element {
>
> background-color: rgb(255,0,0);
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark134 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*
>
> /\*RGBa\*/
>
> .element {
>
> /\*Background has 50% opacity\*/ background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0,
> .5);
>
> }
>
> /\*HSL\*/
>
> .element {
>
> background-color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
>
> }
>
> /\*HSLa\*/
>
> .element {
>
> /\*Background has 50% opacity\*/
>
> background-color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, .5);
>
> }

### background-image {#background-image-1}

> The background-image CSS property sets an image or gradient in the
> background of an element, and it looks like this:
>
> background-image: url(../images/background.jpg);
>
> Alternatively, it could also look like this:
>
> background-image: linear-gradient(red, orange);

#### Description

> This property supports the JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, and WebP image formats.
> We can also use the none value to declare the absence of an image.
>
> An element can also have several background images in a single
> declaration. When it comes to gradients, there are two styles:
> **Linear** and **Radial**.

##### Linear

> Its syntax is linear-gradient. These gradients can go vertical,
> horizontal, or diagonal.

[]{#_bookmark135 .anchor}*Chapter 4*

##### Radial

> Its syntax is radial-gradient. These gradients are circular in nature,
> and by
>
> default, they will adapt to an element\'s dimension. For example, if
> the element is a perfect square, it would make a perfect circular
> radial gradient. However, if the element is a rectangle, then the
> radial gradient would look like an oval.
>
> We can add as many colors in a gradient as we want or need to. Unless
> it is strictly necessary, I recommend that you steer away from doing
> so, as it can have a negative impact on browser performance.
>
> Additionally, in order to give us more control over the gradients, we
> can define where a gradient color stops so that the following one can
> start. This is called **color stops**. Color stops can be defined in
> pixels or percentages. Percentages are more commonly used because of
> their relative nature, which helps maintain the integrity and
> proportions of the gradients.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Graphic file\*/
>
> .element {
>
> background-image: url(../images/bg-texture.jpg);
>
> }
>
> /\*Multiple images\*/
>
> .element { background-image:
>
> url(../images/bg-icon.svg), url(../images/bg-texture.jpg);
>
> }
>
> /\*Linear gradient\*/
>
> .element {
>
> background-image: linear-gradient(red, orange);
>
> }
>
> /\*Linear Gradient with color stops\*/
>
> .element {
>
> background-image: linear-gradient(red 40px, orange 25%, green);
>
> }
>
> /\*Radial gradient\*/
>
> .element {
>
> background-image: radial-gradient(red, orange);
>

>
> }

### background-origin {#background-origin-1}

> The background-origin CSS property defines how the background gets
> rendered
>
> inside an element, and it looks like this:
>
> background-origin: border-box;

#### Description

> This property works similarly to the background-clip CSS property,
> except that with background-origin, the background is resized instead
> of clipped.
>
> There are four values: border-box, padding-box, content-box, and
> inherit.

-   border-box: The background extends all the way to the edge of the
    container, but under the border

-   padding-box: The background extends to meet the border edge to edge

-   content-box: The background is rendered inside the content box

-   inherit: This is the default value

> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> background-origin: border-box;
>
> }
>
> Here is a demo in CodePen: <http://tiny.cc/background-origin>

#### background-position

> The background-position CSS property allows us to place the background
> (image or gradient) anywhere within its parent container, and it looks
> like this:
>
> background-position: 10px 50%;

##### Description

> We can use three different types of values: predefined *keywords*,
> *percentage*, and
>
> *length*.

##### Predefined keywords

> Values such as left, right, top, and bottom are the predefined
> keywords.

[]{#_bookmark137 .anchor}*Chapter 4*

##### Percentages

> Values such as 5% and 80%.

##### Length

> Values such as 15px 130px.
>
> This property requires you to declare two values: the first value
> relates to the *x* axis (horizontal) and the second value to the *y*
> axis (vertical).
>
> The default value is 0 0; which is exactly the same as left top.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Default values\*/
>
> .element {
>
> background-position: 0 0;
>
> }
>
> /\*Keyword values\*/
>
> .element {
>
> background-position: right bottom;
>
> }
>
> /\*Percentages values\*/
>
> .element {
>
> background-position: 5% 80%;
>
> }
>
> /\*Length values\*/
>
> .element {
>
> background-position: 15px 130px;
>
> }
>
> Here is a demo in CodePen: <http://tiny.cc/background-position>

#### background-repeat

> The background-repeat CSS property has two functions:

1.  To define whether a background image is repeated or not

2.  To determine how the background image is repeated It looks like
    this:

> background-repeat: no-repeat;
>
> []{#_bookmark138 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*
>
> Alternatively, it could also look like this:
>
> background-repeat-x: repeat;

##### Description

> This property only works if background-image has been declared. There
> are four values: repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, and no-repeat.

-   repeat: The background image will repeat in both *x* and *y* axes.
    This will completely fill the container. This is the default value.

-   repeat-x: The background image will only repeat in the *x* axis,
    hence, horizontally.

-   repeat-y: The background image will only repeat in the *y* axis,
    hence, vertically.

-   no-repeat: The background image will not be repeated and will only
    display one instance of it.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Default value\*/
>
> .repeat { background-repeat: repeat; }
>
> /\*Repeat horizontally\*/
>
> .repeat-x { background-repeat: repeat-x; }
>
> /\*Repeat vertically\*/
>
> .repeat-y { background-repeat: repeat-y; }
>
> /\*No repeat\*/
>
> .no-repeat { background-repeat: no-repeat; }
>
> Here is a demo in CodePen: <http://tiny.cc/background-repeat>

#### background-size

> The background-size CSS property defines the size of the background
> image, and it
>
> looks like this:
>
> background-size: contain;

##### Description

> There are five values: a *length* value, a *percentage* value, auto,
> contain, and cover.

##### Length value

> *Chapter 4*
>
> This is when we use one of the following units: px, em, in, mm, cm,
> vw, and so on.

##### Percentage value

> This is when we use percentages such as 50%, 85%, and so on.

##### auto

> This value scales the image in the corresponding direction (horizontal
> or vertical) in order to maintain its aspect ratio and not deform it.

##### contain

> This value makes sure the image can be seen completely within its
> parent container. The image does not bleed on the edges; it\'s
> \"contained\".

##### cover

> This value scales the image and takes the longest dimension
> (horizontal or vertical). It makes sure that the image completely
> covers that dimension. Bleeding can occur if the container and the
> image have different aspect ratios.
>
> When declaring the size of the background, we can use either one or
> two values. The
>
> first value is the *width*, and the second is the *height* of the
> background image.
>
> Using one value means that the second value is set to auto. When using
> two values,
>
> we are then defining the width and height values of the background
> image.
>
> We can use any measurement unit we want. Pixels, percentages, and the
> auto value are the most commonly used though.
>
> We can even combine multiple images in the same container. The
> background shorthand property is the best way to handle this
> situation.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .contain {
>
> background-size: contain;
>
> }
>
> .cover {
>
> background-size: cover;
>
> }
>
> .auto {
>
> background-size: auto;
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark140 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*

> url(../images/image-1.jpg), url(../images/image-2.jpg);
>
> background-size: 150px 100px, cover;
>
> }
>
> Here is a demo in CodePen: <http://tiny.cc/background-size>

#### background

> The background CSS property is the shorthand in which we can list all
> background values.
>
> I often see many developers write the longhand version of the property
> to declare a single value, such as a color. Here is an example:
>
> background-color: red;
>
> Although this is totally fine, I prefer to use the shorthand version
> for practically
>
> everything:
>
> background: red;
>
> This is a bit more scalable because if we need to add any other
> values, all we need to do is add the new value to this declaration
> rather than writing a separate one. However, at the end, it\'s all a
> matter of personal style.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*BG color\*/
>
> .element { background: red; }
>
> /\*BG color and image\*/
>
> .element { background: url(../images/bg.png) red; }
>
> /\*BG color, image and position\*/
>
> .element { background: url(../images/bg.png) 50% 50% red; }
>
> /\*BG color, image, position and do not repeat\*/
>
> .element { background: url(../images/bg.png) 50% 50% red no- repeat; }
>
> /\*BG color, image, position, do not repeat and size\*/
>
> .element { background: url(../images/bg.png) 50% 50% / contain red
> no-repeat; }
>
> /\*BG color, image, position, do not repeat, size and clip\*/
>
> .element { background: url(../images/bg.png) 50% 50% / contain red

> no-repeat content-box fixed; }

## Box model

> Every element in the web is a square, and as such, it has intrinsic
> characteristics: width, height, padding, border, and margin. All these
> characteristics, put together, make the box model.
>
> The almighty box model is one of the most talked about subjects in the
> CSS industry due to IE6 and IE7 being the most popular browsers back
> in the day. However, they had major issues interpreting this simple
> CSS concept. This meant the web designers and developers had to come
> up with all sorts of tricks to get around such a problem. Those days
> are now gone, for the most part at least.
>
> Let\'s move on to the box model properties.

### width {#width}

> The width CSS property specifies the width of an element\'s content
> area, and it looks like this:
>
> width: 10px;
>
> Alternatively, it could also look like this:
>
> width: 10px 50px;

#### Description

> The content area is inside the padding, border, and margin of the
> element.
>
> Let\'s talk about the most used values and keywords: the *length*
> value, *percentage*
>
> value, auto, max-content, min-content, and fit-content.

##### Length value

> This is basically when we use one of the following units: px, em, in,
> mm, cm, vw, and so on.

##### Percentage value

> This is when we use percentages such as 50%, 85%, and so on.
>
> []{#_bookmark142 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*

##### auto

> This is a keyword value that allows the browser to choose the width of
> the element.

##### max-content

> This is a keyword value that makes the container take the width of its
> content.

##### min-content

> This is a keyword value that makes the container as small as possible
> depending on its content.

##### fit-content

> This is a keyword value that makes the container match the width of
> its content. This works great on containers with unknown or variable
> width.
>
> You can find more information on MDN at <http://tiny.cc/mdn-width>
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*max-content\*/
>
> .element {

> width: max-content;
>
> }
>
> /\*min-content\*/
>
> .element {
>
> width: min-content;

> }
>
> /\*fit-content\*/
>
> .element {
>
> width: fit-content;
>
> }
>
> Here is a demo in CodePen: <http://tiny.cc/width>

### height {#height}

> The height CSS property specifies the height of an element\'s *content
> area*, and it looks like this:
>
> height: 200px;

[]{#_bookmark143 .anchor}*Chapter 4*

#### Description

> The *content area* is inside the padding, border, and margin of the
> element. The most used values are a *length* value, a *percentage*
> value, and inherit.

##### Length value

> This is basically when we use one of the following units: px, em, in,
> mm, cm, vw, and so on.

##### Percentage value

> This is when we use percentages such as 50%, 85%, and so on.

##### inherit

> With this keyword, the element will inherit its parent container\'s
> height. You can find more information on MDN at
> <http://tiny.cc/mdn-height> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Length value\*/
>
> .element { height: 200px;
>
> }
>
> /\*Percentage value\*/
>
> .element { height: 50%;
>
> }
>
> /\*Inherit value\*/
>
> .element {
>
> height: inherit;
>
> }

### padding {#padding-1}

> The padding CSS property creates a space on all four sides of an
> element on the inside, between its content and the edges, and it looks
> like this:
>
> padding: 10px;
>
> Alternatively, it could also look like this:
>
> padding: 10px 15px;
>
> []{#_bookmark144 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*

#### Description

> Borders and margins are outside of the content area and do not get
> affected by the padding.
>
> The padding property is the shorthand for padding-top, padding-right,
> padding- bottom, and padding-left. We can use one, two, three, or all
> four values.

-   **One value**: This means that all four sides have the same value.

-   **Two values**: The first value is for Top and Bottom. The second
    value is for Left and Right.

-   **Three values**: The first value is for Top. The second value is
    for Left and Right. The third value is for Bottom.

-   **Four values**: The first value is for Top. The second is for
    Right. The third is for Bottom. The fourth is for Left.

> Negative values are not allowed.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Shorthand, ONE value: all four sides have the same padding\*/
>
> .element { padding: 10px; }
>
> /\*Shorthand, TWO values: Top & Bottom - Left & Right\*/
>
> .element { padding: 10px 15px; }
>
> /\*Shorthand, THREE values: Top - Left & Right - Bottom\*/
>
> .element { padding: 10px 15px 20px; }
>
> /\*Shorthand, FOUR values: Top - Right - Bottom - Left\*/
>
> .element { padding: 10px 15px 20px 25px; }
>
> /\*Longhand, all values. They can go in any order\*/
>
> .element {

### margin {#margin-1}

> The margin CSS property defines an outside space on one, two, three or
> all four sides
>
> of an element, and it looks like this:
>
> margin: 10px;

[]{#_bookmark145 .anchor}*Chapter 4*

> Alternatively, it could also look like this:
>
> margin: 10px 15px;

#### Description

> The margin property is the shorthand for margin-top, margin-right,
> margin- bottom, and margin-left. Just like with padding, we can use
> one, two, three, or all four values.

-   **One value**: This means that all four sides have the same padding.

-   **Two values**: The first value is for Top and Bottom. The second
    value is for Left and Right.

-   **Three values**: The first value is for Top. The second value is
    for Left and Right. The third value is for Bottom.

-   **Four values**: The first value is for Top. The second is for
    Right. The third is for Bottom. The fourth value is for Left.

> Negative values are allowed.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Shorthand, ONE value: all four sides have the same padding\*/
>
> .element { margin: 10px; }
>
> /\*Shorthand, TWO values: Top & Bottom - Left & Right\*/
>
> .element { margin: 10px 15px; }
>
> /\*Shorthand, THREE values: Top - Left & Right - Bottom\*/
>
> .element { margin: 10px 15px 20px; }
>
> /\*Shorthand, FOUR values: Top - Right - Bottom - Left\*/
>
> .element { margin: 10px 15px 20px 25px; }
>
> /\*Longhand, all values. They 1can go in any order\*/
>
> .element {
>
> margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;
> margin-left: 25px;
>
> }

#### Collapsing margins

> There is a particular behavior with the margins. If two stacked
> elements have top and bottom margins, the margins are not added.
> Instead, the larger value is the only one taken into account.
>
> []{#_bookmark146 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*
>
> For example, we have an \<h1\> heading and a \<p\> paragraph. The
> heading has a bottom margin of 20px, and the paragraph has a top
> margin of 10px.
>
> Our senses immediately tell us that the total margin is 30px, but in
> reality, because vertical margins collapse, only the largest value is
> considered, in this case, 20px.
>
> The reason for this is that many elements, such as headings and
> paragraphs in our example, have both top and bottom margins. So,
> having the margins collapse allows the content and layout to maintain
> consistency and avoid creating undesired extra spacing between stacked
> elements.
>
> This is also good because it saves us the effort of having to
> \"negate\" margins on every stacked element that has top and bottom
> margins, again, to avoid creating those extra spaces.
>
> The way I see it, is that collapsing margins is an editorial feature
> of the CSS margin property. I hope that the prior explanations help
> embrace this behavior.

> Here is a demo in CodePen: <http://tiny.cc/collapsing-margins>

### border {#border-1}

> The border CSS property is the shorthand that defines an element\'s
> border thickness,
>
> style, and color.
>
> The border property and all its sister properties (border-width,
> border-style, and border-color) and variations are self-explanatory,
> so there\'s no need for a *Description* section like in prior
> properties.
>
> The CSS example ahead will help clarify the use of these properties.

#### border-width

> This is the thickness of the border. It can be declared using px or
> em, but px yields more controllable results.

#### border-style

> This defines the type of line or no line at all. It supports the
> following values: dashed, dotted, double, groove, hidden, inset, none,
> outset, ridge, and solid.

#### border-color

> *Chapter 4*
>
> This defines the color of the line. It supports all color modes: HEX,
> RGB, RGBa, HSL, HSLs, and color name.
>
> Keep in mind that all HTML elements are squares, so we can target any
> side of an element with border-top-color, border-right-color,
> border-bottom-color, or border-left-color.
>
> The order of the values in the shorthand does not affect the output.
>
> In the following example, the top rule in *shorthand syntax*
> accomplishes exactly the same accomplishment as the bottom rule with
> the *longhand syntax*:
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Shorthand\*/
>
> .element-shorthand { border: 10px solid green;
>
> }
>
> /\*Longhand\*/
>
> .element-longhand {
>
> /\*Width\*/
>
> border-top-width: 10px; border-right-width: 10px; border-bottom-width:
> 10px; border-left-width: 10px;
>
> /\*Style\*/
>
> border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid;
> border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid;
>
> /\*Color\*/
>
> border-top-color: green; border-right-color: green;

### box-sizing {#box-sizing-1}

> The box-sizing CSS property allows us to change the way browsers
> understand the box model by default, and it looks like this:
>
> box-sizing: border-box;

#### Description

> There are two values: content-box and border-box.

##### content-box

> This is the default value. The padding, border, and margin values are
> added to the final width and height of the element. This value is
> rarely used exactly because of the behavior I just described.

##### border-box

> On the other hand, since this value changes the box model, the padding
> and border
>
> are not added to the final width and height of the element but only to
> the margin.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Padding, border and margin are added to the element\'s
> dimensions\*/
>
> .element {
>
> box-sizing: content-box;

### max-height {#max-height-1}

> The max-height CSS property defines the maximum height of an element,
> and it
>
> looks like this:
>
> max-height: 150px;

#### Description

> *Chapter 4*
>
> The max-height attribute overrides the height property. Negative
> values are not allowed.
>
> The most used values are a *length* value and a *percentage* value.

##### Length value

> This is when we use one of the following units: px, em, in, mm, cm,
> vw, and so on.

##### Percentage value

> This is when we use percentages such as 50%, 85%, and so on.

### object-fit {#object-fit-1}

> The object-fit CSS property defines how a *replaced element* fits
> inside its content
>
> box, and it looks like this:
>
> object-fit: cover;

#### Description

> A *replaced element* is an HTML element whose content and dimensions
> are intrinsic (defined by the element itself) and are not defined by
> CSS or by its context or surroundings.
>
> Examples of *replaced elements* are \<img\>, \<video\>, \<audio\>,
> \<canvas\>, \<iframe\>,
>
> \<textarea\>, \<object\>, \<input\>, \<button\>, \<br\>, and \<hr\>.
>
> Now, the most important characteristic of replaced elements is that we
> cannot apply generated content to them via CSS using the :before or
> :after pseudo-element selectors.
>
> This property can come in handy when we want a group of thumbnails to
> have the same width and height, but without distorting the images.
> However, the images for the thumbnails are uploaded by users, which
> means that the uploaded images can be of all sizes and different
> aspect ratios. The object-fit CSS property can help us have control of
> the thumbnails in such a situation.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image25.png){width="0.3199486001749781in"
> height="0.39964348206474193in"}The content inside the replaced element
> is centered vertically and horizontally by default. However, the
> content can be repositioned using the object-position property.
>
> There are four keyword values: contain, cover, fill, none, and
> scale-down.

##### contain

> The aspect ratio of the content inside the replaced element is
> preserved. This content is enlarged as much as possible until it
> reaches its maximum size defined by its width and height. It\'s
> possible to see some \"unfilled\" areas of the element due to
> preservation of the aspect ratio.

[]{#_bookmark153 .anchor}*Chapter 4*

##### cover

> The aspect ratio of the content inside the replaced element is
> preserved. This content is enlarged as much as possible until it
> completely fills or \"covers\" the entire content box.

##### fill

> The aspect ratio of the content inside the replaced element is not
> necessarily
>
> preserved. This means that when filling the entire content box, the
> content of the replaced element can be stretched or shrunk during the
> scaling up or scaling down of the content.

##### none

> No resizing is done.

##### scale-down

> This acts as if none or contain were declared. The idea here is that
> the browser will try to figure out the smallest concrete size of the
> content inside the replaced element in order to make it fit in its
> content box while preserving the aspect ratio of the content inside
> the replaced element.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> img {
>
> width: 15em; height: 25em;
>
> **object-fit: contain;**
>
> }
>
> Here is a demo in CodePen: <http://tiny.cc/object-fit-position>

### object-position {#object-position-1}

> The object-position CSS property defines the location of the content
> of the
>
> replaced element, and it looks like this:
>
> object-position: right bottom;

#### Description

> As described in the Tip of the object-fit CSS property, by default,
> the content of the
>
> replaced element is placed in the center of the content box, which is
> 50% 50%.
>
> []{#_bookmark154 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*
>
> Now, this property behaves similarly to the background-position CSS
> property. This means, we can declare either *one* or *two* values.

> The values are either *length* or *percentages* of *keyword* values
> top, right, bottom, or
>
> left. Negative values are allowed.
>

## Border radius {#border-radius-1}

> With this property, we can not only make rounded corners but also
> circles, ellipses, and other interesting shapes.
>
> I admit that the term \"rounded corners\" is far less obscure than
> \"border radius\".

### border-radius {#border-radius-2}

> The border-radius CSS property allows us to make rounded corners on
> almost any HTML element, and it looks like this:
>
> border-radius: 20px;

#### Description

> The border-radius attribute is also the shorthand syntax for the
> border-top-left- radius, border-top-right-radius,
> border-bottom-right-radius, and border- bottom-left-radius properties.
>
> []{#_bookmark155 .anchor}Using either a circle or an ellipse, we can

## Unit

> CSS unit is a type of data with which we can define measurements, and
> it looks like this:
>
> max-height: 150**px**;
>
> Alternatively, it could also look like this:
>
> transform: rotate(45**deg**);
>
> There is no space between the number and the unit.
>
> In most cases, the unit isn\'t required after the number 0 (zero).
>
> There are several types of length units, such as described in the
> following explanations.

### Relative length units

> They are dependent on another element\'s length (usually, a parent
> element in the DOM) that relates directly to the element in question.
> When the other element\'s length changes, the length of the element in
> question maintains the defined proportion. In other words, there is no
> need to declare the length of the child element again.

#### Description

> *Chapter 4*
>
> Relative units are always the best way to go if we want to build
> scalable systems. Setting values in a single element and then
> modifying that single element to affect the whole system saves a lot
> of time and many headaches.

##### ex

> The ex suffix stands for an element\'s x-height. The ex CSS unit
> refers to the height of lowercase *x*. This height is dependent on the
> font. In other words, the heights can be different if we are using
> Arial than if we are using Verdana, even if the value is the same.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { padding: 2ex;
>
> }

##### ch

> The ch suffix stands for character. The ch CSS unit refers to the
> width of the character 0 (zero). This width is dependent on the font.
> In other words, the widths can be different if we are using Arial than
> if we are using Verdana, even if the value is the same.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { padding: 2ch;
>
> }

##### em {#em-2}

> The em suffix stands for the pronunciation of the letter *m*, and it
> represented the width of the lower case *m* in the print and
> typography industries. In CSS, the em unit represents a calculation of
> an element\'s font-size property.
>
> This unit can be used together with many CSS properties, but the most
> common use
>
> is to define font-size elements.
>
> However, many web designers and developers prefer to use rem units to
> avoid the inheritance issue em units have in nested elements (3-4 or
> more levels deep).
>
> []{#_bookmark158 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> font: 1.5em Arial, Helvetica, san-serif;
>
> }

##### rem

> The rem suffix stands for the abbreviation of the term *root element*.
> The rem CSS unit represents the font size of the root element in a
> markup document. A markup document is not only an HTML document; it
> can also be an XML, SVG, or other markup-based document.
>
> Granted that in this guide, we are referring to an HTML document, and
> since this is the case, the root element is the \<html\> element.
>
> A very common practice is to set the font size on the \<html\> element
> to 62.5%. This way, when we\'re setting our font sizes for other
> elements, we can still think in pixels, but write in rem units to
> maintain the relative font size when scaling up or down our document
> in our responsive projects.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> html {
>
> font-size: 62.5%;
>
> }
>
> h1 {
>
> /\*It\'s the same as 22px\*/ font-size: 2.2rem;
>
> }

##### The % sign

> The % sign is what it implies, percentage. In CSS em units and
> percentage units yield the same result. Percentage values, such as any
> of the other relative units, are dependent on another value, usually
> that of the parent element.
>
> Like all other relative units, percentages and responsive web design
> go hand in hand.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { margin: 0 1%;
>
> }

[]{#_bookmark159 .anchor}*Chapter 4*

### Viewport-relative length units

> These units relate to the viewport. If the viewport\'s dimensions
> change, the
>
> properties using viewport-relative length values adapt to the new
> dimensions of the view window.

#### Description

> These units are a godsend in my book. They do what we would expect of
> fonts in a responsive world: enlarge or shrink according to the width
> or height of the viewport.
>
> Let\'s check them out.

##### vh

> The vh suffix stands for *viewport height*. The vh CSS unit relates to
> the height of the viewport. The value of vh is 1/100th of the height
> of the viewport.
>
> For example, if we declare the font-size of an element as 1vh, and the
> browser window is 500px, the font size is then 5px.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> font-size: 1vh;
>
> }

##### vw

> The vw suffix stands for *viewport width*. The vw CSS unit relates to
> the width of the viewport. The value of vw is 1/100th of the width of
> the viewport.
>
> For example, if we declare the font-size of an element as 1vh, and the
> browser window is 1400px, the font size is then 14px.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> font-size: 1vw;
>
> }

##### vmin

> The vmin suffix stands for *viewport minimum*. The vmin CSS unit
> relates to the smallest value of the viewport, of either its height or
> its width. The value of vmin is 1/100th of the side with the smallest
> length of the viewport.
>
> []{#_bookmark160 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*
>
> For example, if we declare the font-size of an element as 1vmin and
> the browser\'s viewport is 600 × 800, the font size is then 6px.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> font-size: 1vmin;
>
> }

##### vmax

> The vmax suffix stands for viewport maximum. The vmax CSS unit relates
> to the largest value of the viewport, of either its height or its
> width. The value of vmax is 1/100th of the side with the largest
> length of the viewport.
>
> For example, if we declare the font-size of an element as 1vmax, and
> the browser\'s viewport is 600 × 800, the font size is then 8px.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> font-size: 1vmax;
>
> }

### Absolute length units

> These units represent a physical dimension of an element. Some units
> in CSS come from the printing world, and although it\'s not common to
> use them, it\'s important to know as much as we can about them.

#### Description

> These types of units relate directly to a physical measurement. They
> work best when the output environment is known, like in print.
>
> The most used absolute unit is the pixel (px). A pixel is known to be
> a single dot on a screen. The thing is that there is no industry
> standard for the size of that dot.
>
> In other words, a pixel in a standard LED/LCD display (for example, a
> monitor or a TV) has different sizes than a pixel in a high-density
> screen. Even the pixel sizes between high-density screens are
> different.
>
> Let\'s see what each abbreviation means, and at the end of the
> section, we\'ll be able to see a single example with all the units.

> The cm suffix stands for *centimeter*.

##### mm

> The mm suffix stands for *millimeter*.

##### in

> The in suffix stands for *inch*.

##### pc

> The pc suffix stands for *pica*.

##### pt

> The pt suffix stands for *point*.

### Angle data types

> These units represent angle values.

#### Description

> These units are used whenever we want to rotate an element via the
> transform
>
> property.
>
> Aside from the deg data type, the other angle data type units aren\'t
> really that common.
>
> Let\'s check them out though.

##### deg

> The deg suffix stands for *degrees*.

##### grad

> The grad suffix stands for *gradients*.

##### rad

> The rad suffix stands for *radians*.

##### turn

> The turn suffix is not an abbreviation; it\'s the actual word *turn*.
> There is one turn in a full circle, so if we\'re going to make a
> horizontal rectangle rotate 90 degrees to make it vertical, we would
> define it as .25turn, because it\'s ¼th of the complete turn.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> All the following values represent units that resemble a 90-degree
> turn of an element but in different angle data types:
>
> /\*Degrees\*/
>
> .element { transform: rotate(90deg); }
>
> /\*Gradians\*/
>
> .element { transform: rotate(100grad); }
>
> /\*Radians\*/
>
> .element { transform: rotate(89.535rad); }
>
> /\*Turn\*/
>
> .element { transform: rotate(.25turn); }

### Resolution units

> *Chapter 4*
>
> These units represent the screen density of pixels on any given output
> or device. Unlike relative and absolute units, it\'s necessary to add
> the unit to the value 0 (zero).

#### Description

> Whenever we need to consider density screens, resolution units will do
> the heavy lifting for us. They are used in media queries.
>
> Let\'s see how they work.

##### dpi

> The dpi suffix stands for *dots per inch*. Screens contain 72 or 96
> dpi, whereas a printed document has much larger dpi. 1 inch = 2.54 cm,
> so 1dpi≈ 0.39dpcm.

##### dpcm

> The dpcm suffix stands for *dots per centimeter*. 1 inch = 2.54 cm, so
> 1dpcm≈ 2.54dpi.

##### dppx

> The dppx suffix stands for *dots per pixel*. 1dppx = 96dpi due to the
> 1:96 fixed ratio of
>
> CSS pixels.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*\*@2x pixel ratio\*\*/
>
> /\*Dots per inch\*/
>
> \@media (min-resolution: 192dpi) { \... }
>
> /\*Dots per centimeter\*/
>
> \@media (min-resolution: 75.5906dpcm) { \... }
>
> /\*Dots per pixel\*/
>
> \@media (min-resolution: 2dppx) { \... }

### Duration units

> These units represent the duration of an animation in either seconds
> or milliseconds.

#### Description

> These units are quite straightforward and are only used in CSS
> animations.
>
> []{#_bookmark164 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*

> ![](./images-ref/media/image28.png){width="0.3199486001749781in"
> height="0.3996576990376203in"}You may think that because all other
> units use two, three, or four letters in their abbreviation (px, dip,
> dpcm, and so on). Always remember: when declaring the seconds unit
> only one s is used. Using sec or secs is incorrect.

##### ms

> The ms suffix stands for *milliseconds*. 1000ms= 1 second.

##### s {#s-2}

> The s suffix stands for *seconds*. 1s = 1000 milliseconds.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Milliseconds\*/
>
> .element { animation-duration: 3ms; }
>
> .element { transition: .003s; }
>
> /\*Seconds\*/
>
> .element { animation-duration: 3s; }
>
> .element { transition: 3000ms; }

### Column

> CSS columns is the most versatile way to fluidly distribute long
> strings of content while retaining scalability. If the content grows
> or is reduced, it would automatically reflow in the available space of
> the declared columns.
>
> Although not necessarily ideal, actual elements such as DIVs can also
> be distributed in columns with the CSS columns property.
>
> Let\'s dive in.

#### column-count

> The column-count CSS property defines the number of columns of an
> element, and it looks like this:
>
> column-count:3;

[]{#_bookmark165 .anchor}*Chapter 4*

##### Description

> We can use either a *number* value or the keyword auto.
>
> When we use the auto keyword, we\'re letting the browser decide how
> many
>
> columns can fit within the available space. This is a very powerful
> and robust
>
> solution for responsive layouts. However, it is required that we
> declare column- width for this to work.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Let the browser decide\*/
>
> .element {
>
> **column-count: auto;**
>
> column-width: 200px;
>
> }
>
> /\*Specific number of columns\*/
>
> .element {
>
> **column-count: 3;**
>
> }

#### column-fill

> The column-fill CSS property controls how the content is assigned
> across columns, and it looks like this:
>
> column-fill: balance;

##### Description

> There are two keywords: auto and balance.

-   auto: This means that the content is filled sequentially. Basically,
    as space becomes available, the content will start filling it. This
    makes the parent container grow vertically by making the columns
    taller in order to fit the content.

-   balance: This means that the content will be equally distributed in
    the available columns. For this to work, we need to declare a height
    on the parent container. This will make sure that the columns are of
    the specific height as well. The problem with this is that the
    content will just keep flowing outside the parent container if the
    parent container becomes too small.

> []{#_bookmark166 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Balance\*/

>
> }
>
> /\*Auto\*/
>
> .element {
>
> **column-fill: auto;**
>
> column-count: 4;
>
> }

#### column-gap

> The column-gap CSS property defines the space between columns. In
> editorial terms, this space is the \"gutter\", and it looks like this:
>
> column-gap: 50px;

##### Description

> There are two values: the auto keyword and a *length* value.

-   auto: This is the default value defined by the spec, which is 1em.

-   Length value: We define this using px or em.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Auto = 1em\*/
>
> .element {
>
> **column-gap: auto;**
>
> column-count: 4;
>
> }
>
> /\*Length value: px or em\*/
>
> .element {
>
> **column-gap: 50px;**
>
> column-count: 4;
>
> }

#### column-rule

> *Chapter 4*
>
> The column-rule CSS property creates or draws a vertical line that
> \"separates\" the columns, and it looks like this:
>
> column-rule: 2px solid black;

##### Description

> We can define three aspects of the column-rule CSS property: the
> thickness or width; the style, which are the same styles of the
> border-style property; and color.
>
> The column-rule CSS property is the shorthand of the following
> properties:

-   column-rule-width: This can be just a length value (a number), or we
    can use any of these keywords: thin, medium, or thick.

-   column-rule-style: This can be any of the border-style values, such
    as

> dotted, dashed, inset, and so on.

-   column-rule-color: This is a color defined in any format: HEX, RGB,
    or HSL. It also supports alpha channel, so RGBa and HSLa are
    allowed.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Length, solid line and RGBa\*/
>
> .element {
>
> column-gap: auto; column-count: 4;
>
> **column-rule: 2px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, .3);**
>
> }
>
> /\*Keyword, dotted and color name\*/
>
> .element {
>
> column-gap: 50px; column-count: 4;
>
> **column-rule: thick dotted black;**
>
> }

#### column-rule-color

> The column-rule-color CSS property defines the color of the dividing
> line between
>
> columns.
>
> Colors can be defined in any format: HEX, RGB, or HSL. It also

>
> columns.
>
> It can be any of the border-style values, for example, dotted, dashed,
> inset, and so on.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> column-rule-style: dotted;

> It can be just a length value (a number), or we can use any of these
> keywords: thin, medium, or thick.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> column-rule-width: 5px;
>
> }

#### column-span

> The column-span CSS property makes an element that\'s supposed to
> behave like a column into an element that spans across all columns.
> The element is still a \"column\", but it now expands the full width
> of the columns, like a block element.
>
> There are two values, none and all, which are self-explanatory.

> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> column-span: all;
>
> }
>
> Here is a demo in CodePen: <http://tiny.cc/column-span>

#### column-width

> The column-width CSS property defines the width of the columns.
>
> When we define the width of the columns, the browser will
> automatically add or
>
> remove columns depending on the available space.
>
> For example, if we say our columns are 200px wide and the parent
> container is 800px, then the browser will include three columns
> (taking into account the default column-gap of 1em). However, if the
> container is at least 450px wide, the browser will fit two columns.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*em value\*/
>
> .element {
>
> column-width: 10em;
>
> }
>
> /\*px value\*/
>
> .element {
>
> column-width: 200px;
>
> }

#### columns

> The columns CSS property is the shorthand that we can use to set
> column-width and
>
> column-count.
>
> It can accept either one or two values in the same declaration. The
> order of the values doesn\'t matter, but it\'s a good measure to
> declare column-width first and column- count second.

## Flexible box (flexbox)

> Flexbox is one of the most useful CSS modules when it comes to
> arranging elements in a container. Flexbox allows elements to grow or
> shrink, depending on the available space in order to maintain the
> integrity of layouts.
>
> Using Flexbox is the next step after using float-based layouts, not
> only because it can be easier to work with and wrap our heads around
> its concepts, but also because it may result in less markup and CSS.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image29.png){width="0.31995188101487315in"
> height="0.3996336395450569in"}A powerful partner to Flexbox is the
> Grid Layout, which is still in its early stages of development, and
> browser support is scarce. Since Grid Layout is out of the scope of
> this section, you can read more on Rachel Andrew\'s project site, Grid
> By Example, at <http://gridbyexample.com/>
>
> Before we dive into the Flexbox properties, the following diagram will
> help us understand the terminology and orientations:

> Let\'s dive into Flexbox properties.

### flex-grow

> *Chapter 4*
>
> This property defines how much a flex item should grow relative to
> other flex items via a flex grow factor, and it looks like this:
>
> flex\--grow: 2;

#### Description

> The flex grow factor is a *number* without a unit. Negative values are
> invalid.
>
> The flex item will grow by the defined grow factor as long as there is
> space to do so. It can grow on both the main or cross axes, depending
> on the direction defined by the flex-direction property, which we\'ll
> talk about in a minute.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*First flex item will take 1 unit of the available space\*/
>
> .element-1 { flex-grow: 1; }
>
> /\*Second and third flex items will take 2 units of the available
> space\*/
>
> .element-2 { flex-grow: 2; }
>
> .element-3 { flex-grow: 2; }
>
> /\*Fourth flex item will take 1 unit of the available space\*/
>
> .element-4 { flex-grow: 1; }

### flex-shrink

> This property defines how much a flex item should shrink relative to
> other flex items via a flex shrink factor, and it looks like this:
>
> flex-shrink: 1;

#### Description

> The flex shrink factor is a *number* without a unit. Negative values
> are invalid.
>
> This is used when the sum of all flex items exceeds the size of the
> flex container. This could be horizontally or vertically (main axis or
> cross axis). By assigning flex shrink factors to one or multiple flex
> items, we can make them fit the size of the flex container.
>
> []{#_bookmark172 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 1]{.underline}*

>
> /\*Fourth flex item will take 1 unit of the available space\*/
>
> .element-4 { flex-shrink: 1; }

### flex-basis {#flex-basis-1}

> This property defines the initial width of a flex item, and it looks
> like this:
>
> flex-basis: 200px;

#### Description

> flex-basis accepts a *length* value with either an absolute or a
> relative length unit (px, em, %, and so on) or the content keyword.
>
> When using content, the container will adapt to the content inside of
> it. Negative values are invalid.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Both elements will be 50% wide\*/
>
> /\*Both elements will be 50% wide\*/

a.  { flex-grow: 1; }

b.  { flex-grow: 1; }

### flex-direction {#flex-direction-1}

> The flex-direction CSS property defines the direction of the flex
> items inside a flex container, and it looks like this:
>
> flex-direction: column;

#### Description

> This property sets the direction in which flex items can be laid out,
> either horizontal
>
> with row or vertical with column.
>
> There are four values: two for horizontal and two for vertical:

##### row

> This lays out the flex items on a horizontal axis. This is the default
> value.
>
> When flex items are laid out with row, they stack side by side from
> left to right.

##### row-reverse

> This is the same as row but in reverse. When flex items are laid out
> with row- reverse, they stack side by side from right to left.

##### column

> This lays out the flex items on a vertical axis.
>
> When flex items are laid out with column, they stack one on top of the
> other, starting from top to bottom.

### flex-wrap {#flex-wrap-1}

> The flex-wrap CSS property defines whether a flex item should wrap or
> not when
>
> the container becomes too small, and it looks like this:
>
> flex-wrap: wrap;

#### Description

> This property accepts one of three keyword values: nowrap, wrap and
> wrap-reverse.

##### nowrap

> This is the default value. It tells the flex item to not wrap.

##### wrap {#wrap-2}

> This tells the flex element to wrap.

##### wrap-reverse

> This tells the flex element to wrap but in reverse.

##### flex-start

> This groups the lines to the start of the container.

##### flex-end

> This groups the lines to the end of the container.

##### center

> This groups the lines to the center of the container.

##### space-around

> This distributes the lines evenly in the container, but the first line
> is placed at the
>
> start of the container and the last line at the end.

##### space-between

> This distributes the lines evenly in the container with an even amount
> of space between each line.

### order {#order-1}

> The order CSS property is used to alter the default order of flex
> items within the
>
> same parent container, and it looks like this:
>
> order: 3;

#### Description

> By default, flex items appear in the same order they appear in the
> source (HTML). The order property allows us to alter the display order
> while maintaining their source order. This property accepts a *number*
> value without a unit.

### justify-content {#justify-content-1}

> The justify-content CSS property works only on flex items. It allows
> the browser to distribute the space in between and around the flex
> items based on their main axes.

#### Description

> This property supports five keyword values: flex-start, flex-end,
> center, space-between, and space-around.

##### flex-start

> This is the default value. It groups and positions the elements to the
> beginning of the container.

##### flex-end

> This groups and positions the elements to the end of the container.

##### center

> This groups and positions the elements to the center of the container.

##### space-between

> This spreads and positions the elements along the container and spaces
> them evenly.
>
> The first and last flex items are flushed against the left-hand and
> right-hand sides respectively. In other words, the first and last flex
> items touch the left and right edges.

##### space-around

> *Chapter 4*
>
> Similar to the space-between property, this spreads and positions the
> elements along the container and spaces them evenly.
>
> However, the first and last flex items do not touch the left and right
> edges.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .flex-container { display: flex;
>
> **justify-content: space-between;**
>
> }

### flex

> The flex CSS property is the shorthand in which we can declare the
> values for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. It\'s recommended
> that you follow this order when declaring the values.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Apply flexbox to the parent container\*/
>
> .flex-container { display: flex; }
>
> /\*Flex items create 4 containers, each of different size.
>
> Each container grows/shrinks proportional to the
>
> flex growth/shrink factorsand the browser automatically calculates the
> flex-basis\*/
>
> .element-1 { flex: 1 4 auto; }
>
> .element-2 { flex: 2 3 auto; }
>
> .element-3 { flex: 3 2 auto; }
>
> .element-4 { flex: 4 1 auto; }

# CSS Properties -- Part 2

> Ok, we\'re through Part 1 of the CSS properties. Indeed, there are
> many, many more properties to talk about.
>
> Let\'s now move on to Part 2.

## Fonts

> In the world of design, fonts are one of the most powerful assets we
> have, and at the same time, they are one of the most underappreciated
> ones.
>
> Typography is so powerful that when we use it correctly, we may even
> get away with not using a single image in our project.
>
> Let\'s take a look at the CSS font properties, shall we?

### font-family {#font-family-1}

> The font-family CSS property defines the font we want an element to
> use, and looks like this:
>
> font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, Baskerville, Georgia, serif;

#### Description

> This property can hold one or multiple font names in its declaration.
> There is no limit as to how many font names it can hold; however, it
> is not only very unlikely to list more than four or five fonts, but
> it\'s also unnecessary.
>
> []{#_bookmark183 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*
>
> The font family names are separated by commas. We call this the *font
> stack*. The browser will read the font stack and use the first one in
> the stack, if it can\'t find it or download it, it will move on to the
> next font family name and so on until it\'s able to use one from the
> stack.
>
> There are two types of font family names: family name and generic
> family name.

##### Family name

> Family names are actually names that represent real fonts, such as
> Times, Arial, Verdana, Monaco, and so on. They should always be listed
> before generic family names in the font stack.

##### Generic family names

> These are the only keywords that represent a system font. They are
> called **fallback** fonts. They should always be listed after the
> family names in the font stack. Generic family names can be monospace,
> san-serif, serif, cursive, and fantasy.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image36.png){width="0.3199475065616798in"
> height="0.3996522309711286in"}It is not mandatory to use quotes
> (single or double) when a font family name has multiple words. For
> example, writing font-family: \"Times New Roman\", serif; is the same
> as writing font-family: Times New Roman, serif;. Note that Times New
> Roman is not quoted in the second example.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, Baskerville, Georgia, serif;
>
> }

### font-feature-settings {#font-feature-settings-1}

> The font-feature-settings CSS property provides control over
> typographic properties in OpenType fonts, and looks like this:
>
> font-feature-settings: \"smcp\";

#### Description

> *Chapter 5*
>
> The font-feature-settings CSS property allows us to control and use
> other alternative
>
> glyphs that come included in some font files.
>
> An example of an alternate glyph is for example when we type the
> fractions 1/2 or 1/4 the font actually includes the \"small
> superscript\" version like ½ and ¼. Or if we type H2O it turns into
> H2O.
>
> Remember, not all fonts contain special glyphs (font features).
>
> To find out what font features a font file has, you can use any of
> these two tools:

1.  Fontdeck.com (text has link <http://fontdeck.com/>) - Find the font
    you want and on the About this typeface, look for the OPENTYPE line,
    there all the font features will be listed for that specific font.

2.  Test OpenType features (text has link
    [http://www.impallari.com/](http://www.impallari.com/testing/index.php)
    [testing/index.php](http://www.impallari.com/testing/index.php)) -
    Just drag and drop your font file(s) and click on the OpenType
    Features link on the top left, a large panel will slide where you
    can select which features to see.

> Here are some of the most common feature tags:

-   dlig: Discretionary ligatures

-   kern: Kerning

-   liga: Standard ligatures

-   lnum: Lining figures

-   onum: Old style figures

-   tnum: Tabular figures

-   smcp: Small capitals

-   ss01, ss02, ss03, ss04... ss20: Stylistic sets (font-dependent)

-   swsh: Swash

> For more information, check out the MDN website:
> [http://tiny.cc/mdn-font-](http://tiny.cc/mdn-font-feature-settings)
> [feature-settings](http://tiny.cc/mdn-font-feature-settings)

> For a complete list of all font features, check the Microsoft site at
> [http://tiny.cc/](http://tiny.cc/msn-font-features-list)
> [msn-font-features-list](http://tiny.cc/msn-font-features-list)
>
> []{#_bookmark185 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Small capitals\*/
>
> .element {
>
> font-feature-settings: \"smcp\";
>
> }

### font-size {#font-size-1}

> The font-size CSS property defines the size of the text of an element,
> and it looks like this:
>
> font-size-settings: \"smcp\";

#### Description

> This property can also be used to change the size of other elements
> since we can compute the value of em, rem, and ex length units as
> well.
>
> There are a few different value types that we can use with the
> font-size CSS property: absolute keywords/size, relative size, length,
> and percentage.

##### Absolute keywords/size

> The sizes defined relate directly to specific font sizes. They can
> also be used to set a
>
> font size of an element based on the parent element\'s font size.
> Values are as follows:

-   xx-small

-   x-small

-   small

-   medium (default value)

-   large

-   x-large

-   xx-large

##### Relative size keywords

> These sizes increase or reduce the font size of an element based on
> the font size of its parent container. The values are:

-   smaller

-   larger

##### Length

> *Chapter 5*
>
> Negative values are invalid. When using px, the font size is absolute;
> it\'s not relative to the font size of the parent container. When
> using em, ex, and ch, the font size is relative to the font size of
> the element\'s parent container. When using rem, the font size is
> relative to the root element, that is, the \<html\> element. When
> using vw, vh, vmax, and vmin the font size is relative to the
> viewport.
>
> To see all the available values of this attribute, refer to the
> *Absolute Length Units*
>
> section.
>
> The most popular units are:

-   px

-   em

-   rem

##### Percentage

> The percentage attribute refers to the percentage of the parent
> element\'s font size. Its unit is %.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Absolute keywords/size\*/
>
> .element { font-size: x-small; }
>
> /\*Relative size\*/
>
> .element { font-size: smaller; }
>
> /\*Length value\*/
>
> .element { font-size: 18px; }
>
> /\*Percentage value\*/
>
> .element { font-size: 62.5%; }

### font-size-adjust

> The font-size-adjust CSS property helps us define the aspect ratio of
> the fonts based on the size difference of the lowercase letter *x* and
> upper case letter *X*, and it looks like this:
>
> font-size-adjust: .5\";
>
> []{#_bookmark187 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

#### Description

> In the font stack, the font sizes can be different from one font to
> the other, thus the styling of the text can considerably vary from the
> intended design. With the font-size-adjust CSS property, we can
> solidly predict that the font sizes are consistent when the browser
> uses any font from the font stack.
>
> This property accepts a *numeric* value without a unit. It can also
> accept decimal values.
>
> A great online tool that can do this for us is Fontdeck\'s
> font-size-adjust web app:
>
> [http://fontdeck.com/support/fontsizeadjust.](http://fontdeck.com/support/fontsizeadjust)
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image37.png){width="0.3199486001749781in"
> height="0.39964129483814526in"}Although Firefox is the only one that
> supports the font-size- adjust property at the time of writing this
> section, I decided to still include it because it will be of great
> value once other browsers start supporting it.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> font-size-adjust: .5;
>
> }

### font-stretch {#font-stretch-1}

> The font-stretch CSS property allows us to select a condensed, normal,
> or
>
> expanded face from the font family in question, and it looks like
> this:
>
> font-stretch: condensed;

#### Description

> The font-stretch property doesn\'t just *stretch* the font to whatever
> we tell it to. It looks for an actual face inside the font file that
> matches the declared style; or at that is as close as possible.
>
> This property supports the following values:

-   ultra-condensed

-   extra-condensed

-   condensed

-   semi-condensed

-   normal

[]{#_bookmark188 .anchor}*Chapter 5*

-   semi-expanded

-   expanded

-   extra-expanded

-   ultra-expanded

> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> font-stretch: condensed;
>
> }

### font-style {#font-style-1}

> The font-style CSS property specifies the font style of an element,
> and it looks like this:
>
> font-style: italic;

#### Description

> The font-style property accepts the following values: normal, italic,
> and
>
> oblique.
>
> Let\'s clear up the difference between italic and oblique. According
> to the spec:
>
> *\"Italic forms are generally cursive in nature, while oblique faces
> are typically sloped versions of the regular face.\"*
>
> This means that when we declare the font style italic, the browser
> will look for the italic face of the font and use that face. A good
> example of this is the typeface *Georgia*; when we use the italic
> property, we can clearly see that it\'s an actual italicized face
> rather than making the normal face oblique.
>
> Oblique makes the Normal face slanted or inclined in order to
> *simulate* italics.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> font-style: italic;
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark189 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

### font-variant {#font-variant-1}

> The font-variant CSS property turns the targeted text into small caps
> and it looks like this:
>
> font-variant: small-caps;

#### Description

> The font-variant property is considered a shorthand in CSS3 and has
> been extended with new values, which developers rarely use.
>
> One thing to note is that if the text is already in all caps and we
> apply the small-caps property to it, the text will not change; it will
> continue to be in all caps.
>
> The most used values are: normal and small-caps. Some of the
> additional
>
> values in CSS3 are small-caps, all-small-caps, petite-caps,
> all-petite-caps, unicase, and titling-caps.
>
> For more information, check out the MDN website:
> <http://tiny.cc/mdn-font-> variant
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> font-variant: small-caps;
>
> }

### font-variant-ligatures {#font-variant-ligatures-1}

> The font-variant-ligatures CSS property defines ligatures in text,
> which specify how glyphs are combined in order to produce a more
> harmonic text, and it looks like this:
>
> font-variantligatures: discretionary-ligatures;

#### Description

> The font-variant-ligatures are common in OpenType fonts.
>
> The font-variant-ligatures property uses the following values:
> common-ligatures, no-common-ligatures, discretionary-ligatures,
> no-discretionary-ligatures, historical-ligatures,
>
> no-historical-ligatures, contextual, no-contextual, and contextual.

[]{#_bookmark190 .anchor}*Chapter 5*

> For more information, check out the MDN website:
> [http://tiny.cc/mdnfont-](http://tiny.cc/mdnfont-variant-ligatures)
> [variant-ligatures](http://tiny.cc/mdnfont-variant-ligatures)
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> font-variant-ligatures: discretionary-ligatures;
>
> }

### font-weight {#font-weight-1}

> The font-weight CSS property defines the thickness (weight) of the
> font, and it looks like this:
>
> font-weight: bold;

#### Description

> This property accepts two types of values: a *numeric* value and a
> *keyword* value.

##### Numeric values

> This property accepts numeric values such as 100, 200, 300, 400, 500,
> 600, 700, 800
>
> and 900.

##### Keyword values

> This property also accepts keyword values such as normal, bold,
> bolder, and
>
> lighter.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image38.png){width="0.31994641294838144in"
> height="0.3996522309711286in"}The normal keyword is the same as 400
> numeric value and the bold
>
> keyword is the same as 700.
>
> One thing to note is that the keywords bolder and lighter are
> dependent on the parent element\'s font weight.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Numeric value\*/
>
> .element { font-weight: 200; }
>
> /\*Keyword value\*/
>
> .element { font-weight: bold; }
>
> []{#_bookmark191 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

### font {#font-1}

> The font CSS property is the shorthand for the font-style,
> font-variant,
>
> font-weight, font-size, line-height, and font-family properties, and
> it looks like this:
>
> font: italic small-caps bold 18px/2 \"Times New Roman\", Times,
> Baskerville, Georgia, serif;

#### Description

> There are a few things to consider when using the font shorthand in
> order for it to work:

-   At least the font-size and font-family properties need to be
    declared

-   If any of the preceding two properties are omitted, the declaration
    will be ignored

-   If any more than these two properties are going to be declared,
    it\'s mandatory to adhere to the following order:

    -   font-style

    -   font-variant

    -   font-weight

    -   font-size

    -   line-height

    -   font-family

> height="0.39963692038495185in"}When declaring the line-height value in
> the shorthand, it always has to go after the font-size property
> separated with a slash \"/\" character, for example, .element { font:
> 12px/1.6 Arial; }.

-   **CSS**:

> /\*All font properties in a single declaration\*/
>
> .element { font: italic small-caps bold 18px/2 \"Times New Roman\",
> Times, Baskerville, Georgia, serif; }
>
> /\*font-style\*/
>
> .element { font-style: italic; }
>
> /\*font-variant\*/
>
> .element { font-variant: small-caps; }
>
> /\*font-weight\*/
>
> .element { font-weight: bold; }
>
> /\*font-size\*/

[]{#_bookmark192 .anchor}*Chapter 5*

> .element { font-size: 18px; }
>
> /\*line-height\*/
>
> .element { line-height: 2; }
>
> /\*font-family\*/
>
> .element { font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, Baskerville,

## Transform {#transform-1}

> CSS transforms have gained such popularity that it\'s rare not to see
> some sort of transformation in a website nowadays---from button shapes
> and animations to layouts.
>
> Let\'s dig in.

### transform {#transform-2}

> The transform CSS property allows us to scale, rotate, skew, and
> translate elements in 2D and 3D spaces, and it looks like this:
>
> transform: translate(-10px, 10%);

#### Description

> This property supports the following values: scale(), skewX() and
> skewY(), translate(), rotate(), matrix(), and perspective().
>
> Note that X-axis equals *horizontal* and Y-axis equals *vertical*.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image40.png){width="0.31994641294838144in"
> height="0.3996522309711286in"}An easy way to remember which axis is
> which is by saying this: \"*x is a cross so the x-axis is across*\".
> <http://tiny.cc/xy-axis>

##### scale()

> The scale() function scales an element. It\'s also the shorthand for
> scaleX() and scaleY() functions. It accepts a *numeric* value without
> a unit. The *numeric* value represents the proportion in which the
> element will be scaled. For example, 2 means that the element will be
> scaled to twice its size. Negative values are valid.
>
> []{#_bookmark193 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

##### skew()

> The skew() function tilts the element. If a single value is declared,
> then it will only tilt the element on the *x* axis. If two values are
> declared, then the element is tilted on both the *x* and *y* axes. The
> skew() function accepts a *numeric* value followed by
>
> the deg, grad, rad, or turn units. However, the deg unit is the most
> commonly used unit. Negative values are valid.

###### skewX() and skewY()

> The skewX() and skewY() functions tilts the element only horizontally
> or vertically.

##### translate()

> The translate() function alters the location of an element. If a
> single value is declared, then it will only translate the element on
> the X-axis. If two values are declared, then the element is translated
> in both the X and Y-axis. Negative values are valid.

###### translateX() and translateY()

> The translateX() and translateY() functions alters the location either
> horizontally or vertically.

##### rotate()

> The rotate() function rotates an element around a fixed point in a 2D
> space. It accepts a *numeric* value followed by the deg, grad, rad, or
> turn units. The deg unit is the most common though. Negative values
> are valid.

##### matrix()

> The matrix() function is shorthand for all transformation values since
> they can be combined here. Granted the complexity of the matrix()
> function, this requires a solid understanding of math.

##### perspective()

> This value gives a 3D perspective to the element; once the perspective
> is set, we can then use any of the other values. The element in
> question will react in a 3D plane. It accepts a *numeric* value with a
> *length* unit.

[]{#_bookmark194 .anchor}*Chapter 5*

> The explanation of the advanced mathematics of the matrix() function
> are out of scope of this book. However, for very detailed
> explanations, you can refer to either of these two articles:

> <http://tiny.cc/css-matrix-1>

-   *The CSS3 matrix() Transform for the Mathematically Challenged* by
    Zoltan Hawryluk at <http://tiny.cc/css-matrix-2>

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Scale the same value in both X an Y-axis\*/
>
> .element { transform: scale(1.1); }
>
> /\*Scale different values for X and Y-axis\*/
>
> .element { transform: scale(1.1, 1.5); }
>
> /\*Tilt the element on X-axis only\*/
>
> .element { transform: skew(10deg); }
>
> /\*Tilt the element on both X and Y-axis\*/
>
> .element { transform: skew(10deg, -20deg); }
>
> /\*Move the element 10px to the right\*/
>
> .element { transform: translate(10px); }
>
> /\*Move the element 10px to the right and 10% down\*/

> .element { transform: translate(-10px, 10%); }
>
> /\*Rotate in a 2D plane\*/

> .element { transform: matrix(2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0); }
>
> /\*Add perspective to the element to make it rotate in a 3D plane\*/
>
> .element { transform: perspective(100px) rotateX(40deg); }

### transform-origin {#transform-origin-1}

> The transform-origin CSS property allows us to change the point of
> origin of the transformed element, and it looks like this:
>
> transform-origin: 50px;

#### Description

> The transform-origin property only works if the transform property is
> declared.
>
> 2D transformations can affect the *x* and *y* axes. 3D transformations
> can change these two as well as the *z* axis.
>
> For a 2D transformation, up to two values can be declared; the first
> one is the X axis
>
> (horizontal) and the second the Y axis (vertical).
>
> []{#_bookmark195 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*
>
> 3D transformations can take up to three values that represent the X,
> Y, and Z axes.
>
> The keywords that are accepted in this property are: top, right,
> bottom, left, and center.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Single value affects both X and Y-axis\*/
>
> .element {
>
> transform: scale(2, 4);
>
> **transform-origin: 50px;**
>
> }
>
> /\*Two values one for each axis\*/
>
> .element {
>
> transform: scale(2, 4);
>
> **transform-origin: 50px -100px;**
>
> }
>
> /\*Keyword value\*/
>
> .element {
>
> transform: scale(2, 4);
>
> **transform-origin: bottom;**
>
> }
>
> /\*Length and keyword values\*/

> **transform-origin: 50px bottom;**
>
> }
>
> /\*Both keyword values\*/
>
> .element {
>
> transform: scale(2, 4);
>
> **transform-origin: right bottom;**
>
> }

### transform-style {#transform-style-1}

> The transform-style CSS property defines whether an element is
> positioned in a
>
> 3D space or 2D space (flat), and it looks like this:
>
> transform-style: preserve-3d;

[]{#_bookmark196 .anchor}*Chapter 5*

#### Description

> This property takes only two values: flat and preserve-3d.
>
> When the preserve-3d property is applied, the elements\' stack on the
> *z* axis can be altered via the translate() function, thus the
> elements can appear in different planes regardless of the order in
> which they appear in the source HTML.
>
> When the flat property is applied, the elements obey the order in

### Transition

> CSS transitions allow us to have very granular control over our
> animations. Let\'s take a look at these properties.

#### transition

> The transition CSS property is the shorthand for all transition
> properties: transition-delay, transition-duration,
> transition-property, and transition-timing-function. It looks like
> this:
>
> transition: width 400ms ease-out 1s;
>
> []{#_bookmark197 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

##### Description

> This property lets us define the transition between two states of an
> element via the
>
> :hover or :active pseudo-classes.
>
> One thing to consider is that the order in which these properties
> appear doesn\'t matter. However, since transition-delay and
> transition-duration use the same value unit, transition-delay will
> always be considered first, followed by transition-duration.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Shorthand with all properties in a single declaration\*/
>
> .element { width: 100px;
>
> /\*property - duration - timing function - delay\*/ transition: width
> 400ms ease-out 1s;
>
> }
>
> /\*Longhand. Each property is declared separately\*/
>
> .element {
>
> transition-property: width; transition-duration: 400ms;
> transition-timing-function: ease-out; transition-delay: 1s;
>
> }
>
> .element:hover { width: 300px;
>
> }

#### transition-delay

> The transition-delay CSS property allows us to set a *timer*. When the
> timer reaches zero, the transition begins. It looks like this:
>
> transition-delay: 1s;

##### Description

> This property accepts a *numeric* value followed by either s or ms,
> which stand for
>
> *seconds* and *milliseconds*, respectively.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> transition-delay: 1s;
>
> }

#### transition-duration

> *Chapter 5*
>
> The transition-duration CSS property allows us to define how long a
> transition
>
> should take from start to end. This is also called a **cycle,** and it
> looks like this:
>
> transition-duration: 400ms;

##### Description

> The transition-duration property accepts a *numeric* value followed by
> either s or
>
> ms, which stand for seconds and milliseconds, respectively.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> transition-duration: 400ms;
>
> }

#### transition-property

> The transition-property CSS property specifies which CSS property or
> properties
>
> will be transitioned.
>
> Not all properties are animatable though. The W3C has a nice list of
> animatable CSS properties, which can be found at
> <http://tiny.cc/w3c-animatable-css-props>

##### Description

> The transition-property CSS property accepts the following values:

-   none: This means that no transitions will take place

-   all: This means that all properties will be transitioned

-   Property name: This means that the specified property or properties
    will be transitioned

> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> transition-property: width;
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark199 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

#### transition-timing-function

> The transition-timing-function CSS property defines how an
> animation\'s speed
>
> should progress throughout its cycles.
>
> Both the transition-timing-function and animation-timing-function
> properties accept the same five predefined values, which are also
> known as easing functions for the **Bézier** curve: ease, ease-in,
> ease-out, ease-in-out, and linear.
>
> Refer to the *animation-timing-function* section for a detailed
> explanation of all the values.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> transition-timing-function: ease-out;
>
> }

## Positioning

> Positioning elements is something we spend a lot of our time on when
> building sites and applications, so having a good understanding of how
> to place an element on a layout is crucial, especially when an element
> can have different positions depending on the available space.
>
> Let\'s see what positioning is all about.

### position {#position-1}

> The position CSS property defines the location of an element.

#### Description

> There are five keyword values for the position property: static,
> absolute, relative, fixed, and sticky.

##### static

> This is the default value of the position property. The element stays
> in the flow of
>
> the document and appears in the actual location where it\'s located in
> the markup.

##### absolute

> The element is removed from the document flow and it\'s positioned in
> relation to its
>
> closest relative positioned ancestor element.

##### relative

> *Chapter 5*
>
> The element does not change positions unless one or several properties
> of top, right, bottom, or left are declared. It also creates a
> *reference position* for absolute positioned child elements.

##### fixed

> The element is removed from the document flow just like the absolute
> positioned elements. However, unlike the absolute positioned elements,
> which are relative to an ancestor element, the fixed elements are
> always relative to the document.

##### sticky

> This value is a mix between the relative and fixed positions. The
> element is treated as relative until a specific point or threshold is
> met, at which point the element is then treated as fixed. At the time
> of writing this, only Firefox supports this property.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Position relative\*/
>
> .element {
>
> position: relative;
>
> }
>
> /\*When the element hits the top of the viewport, it will stay fixed
> at 20px from the top\*/
>
> .element { position: sticky; top: 20px;
>
> }

### top

> The top CSS property is closely tied to the position property.
>
> This property specifies the distance of an element from the top of its
> current location if the element has position: relative; declared or
> from the top of its nearest ancestor when the ancestor has position:
> relative; and the element has position: absolute; declared.
>
> If none of the ancestors have position: relative; declared, the
> absolute positioned element will traverse the DOM until it reaches the
> \<body\> tag, at which point it will position itself at the top of the
> page regardless of its location in the source HTML.
>
> Negative values are valid.
>
> []{#_bookmark201 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

#### Description

> It supports the following values:

-   auto: The auto keyword is the default value. The browser calculates
    the top position.

-   Length value: For the length value, we use one of the following
    units: px, em, in, mm, cm, vw, and so on.

-   Percentage value: For the percentage value, we use percentages like
    50%, 85%, and so on.

>
> If none of the ancestors have position: relative; declared, the
> absolute positioned element will traverse the DOM until it reaches the
> \<body\> tag, at which point it will position itself at the bottom of

> .element { bottom: auto; }
>
> /\*Length value\*/
>
> .element { bottom: 20px; }
>
> /\*Percentage value\*/
>
> .element { bottom: 15%; }

### left {#left-1}

> The left CSS property is closely tied to the position property.
>
> This property specifies the distance of an element from the left of
> its current location if the element has position: relative; declared
> or from the left of its nearest ancestor when the ancestor has
> position: relative; and the element has position: absolute; declared.
>
> If none of the ancestors have position: relative; declared, the
> absolute positioned element will traverse the DOM until it reaches the
> \<body\> tag, at which point it will position itself at the left of
> the page regardless of its location in the source HTML.
>
> Negative values are valid.

#### Description

> The left property supports the following values:

-   auto: The auto keyword is the default value for the left property.
    The browser calculates the top position.

-   Length value: For the length value, we use one of the following
    units: px, em, in, mm, cm, vw, and so on.

-   Percentage value: For the percentage value, we use percentages like

### right {#right-1}

> The right CSS property is closely tied to the position property.
>
> This property specifies the distance of an element from the right of
> its current location if the element has position: relative; declared
> or from the right of its nearest ancestor when the ancestor has
> position: relative; and the element has position: absolute; declared.

> Negative values are valid.

#### Description

> It supports the following values:

-   auto: The auto keyword is the default value for the right property.
    The browser calculates the top position.

-   Length value: For the length value, we use one of the following
    units: px, em, in, mm, cm, vw, and so on.

>
> .element { right: 20px; }
>
> /\*Percentage value\*/
>
> .element { right: 15%; }

### vertical-align

> *Chapter 5*
>
> The vertical-align CSS property controls the vertical positioning of
> an element in order to align it to another element(s) next to it.

#### Description

> It accepts the following values:

-   baseline: This is the default value. It aligns the elements to the
    bottom, exactly at the last line of text regardless of the
    elements\' line height. In other words, it aligns the last line of
    text to baselines of the elements.

-   bottom: This aligns the elements\' containers to the bottom. The
    text and line height of the elements are not considered, only the
    elements\' containers to the bottom.

-   Length value: For the length value, we use one of the following
    units: px, em, in, mm, cm, vw, and so on. Negative values are valid.

-   middle: This aligns the elements to their horizontal center based on
    their vertical midpoint.

-   Percentage value: For the percentage value, we use percentages like
    50%, 85%, and so on. Negative values are valid.

-   sub: This aligns the element to the subscript baseline of the parent
    container.

-   super: This aligns the element to the superscript baseline of the
    parent container.

-   top: This aligns the elements\' containers to the top. The text and
    line height of the elements are not considered.

-   text-bottom: This aligns the elements to the bottom based on the
    parent\'s text baseline. The line height of the elements is not
    considered, only the bottom of their containers is considered.

-   text-top: This aligns the elements to the top based on the parent\'s
    text baseline. The line height of the elements is not considered,
    but the top of their containers is.

> outside of a container should be clipped, and it looks like this:
>
> text-overflow: ellipsis;
>
> []{#_bookmark209 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

#### Description

> For this property to work, two other properties should have to be
> declared:
>
> overflow: hidden; and white-space: nowrap;. There are two keyword
> values: clip and ellipsis.

##### clip

> This cuts the text exactly at the edge of its parent container. This
> may cause the last character to be clipped at any point showing only a
> portion of it.

##### ellipsis

> This adds an ellipsis character \"...\" at the end of the line of

#### Description

> Depending on the font, when this property is applied, we can see
> benefits like better
>
> kerning and better ligatures.
>
> However, since this CSS property is actually an SVG property and is
> not part of any CSS standard, browsers and operating systems apply
> this property at their own discretion, which in turn may not yield the
> desired improvements from one browser and/or platform to another.
>
> In addition to this, some small screen devices have serious
> performance issues when they encounter the text-rendering CSS
> property, especially older iOS and Android devices.

> with extreme caution and make sure you run all pertinent tests.
>
> This property supports four values: auto, optimizeSpeed,
> optimizeLegibility, and geometricPrecision.

##### auto

> This is the default value. The browser tries to make the best educated
> guess as to how to render the text in order to optimize for speed,
> legibility, and geometric precision.
>
> Remember, each browser interprets this property differently.

##### optimizeSpeed

> The browser favors rendering speed over legibility and geometric
> detail. It disables kerning and ligatures.

##### optimizeLegibility

> The browser favors legibility over rendering speed and geometric
> detail. It enables kerning and some optional ligatures. Keep in mind
> that if the browser tries to use any kerning and ligatures, this
> information needs to be contained in the font file, otherwise we
> won\'t see the effects of such features.

##### geometricPrecision

> The browser favors geometric detail over legibility and rendering
> speed. This property helps when scaling fonts.
>
> For example, the kerning in some fonts does not scale correctly, so
> when we apply this value, the browser is capable of keeping the text
> looking nice.

### text-shadow {#text-shadow-1}

> The text-shadow CSS property applies a drop shadow to the text, and it
> looks like this:
>
> text-shadow: 5px -2vw .2cm black;

#### Description

> This property can accept two, three, or four values in the same
> declaration. The first length value in the declaration will always be
> for the x-offset value and the second length value for the y-offset
> value.
>
> These are the four values it supports: x-offset, y-offset, color, and
> blur.

-   x-offset: This sets the horizontal distance of the shadow from the
    text. It\'s declared as a length value (px, em, in, mm, cm, vw, and
    so on). Negative values are valid. This value is mandatory.

-   y-offset: This sets the vertical distance of the shadow from the
    text. It\'s declared as a length value (px, em, in, mm, cm, vw, and
    so on). Negative values are valid. This value is mandatory.

-   color: This is the color of the text shadow. It supports all color
    modes: HEX, RGB, RGBa, HSL, HSLs, and *color name*. This value is
    optional. If it is not specified, the default color will be the same
    color as the text itself.

-   blur: This is the **smudge** effect. It\'s declared as a length
    value (px, em, in, mm, cm, vw, and so on). It supports all color
    modes: HEX, RGB, RGBa, HSL, HSLs,

> and *color name*. This value is optional. If it is not specified, the
> default value is zero (0).
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*2 values: x-offset and y-offset\*/
>
> .element { text-shadow: 5px 10px; }
>
> /\*3 values: x-offset, y-offset and blur. Color value defaults to the
> font color\*/
>
> .element { text-shadow: 5px 2vw 5px; }
>
> /\*4 values: x-offset, y-offset, blur and color name\*/
>
> .element { text-shadow: 5px -2vw .2cm black; }

### text-transform {#text-transform-1}

> The text-transform CSS property controls the capitalization of text,
> and it looks like this:
>
> text-transform: capitalize;

#### Description

> *Chapter 5*
>
> The text-transform property supports the following four keyword
> values: none, capitalize, uppercase, and lowercase.

-   none: This is the default value. No capitalization should be applied
    to the element.

-   capitalize: This capitalizes the first letter of each word. This
    property is smart enough to ignore any special characters or symbols
    at the beginning of the line and capitalize the first letter of the
    first word.

-   uppercase: This changes all the text to upper case/capitals. This
    property can also ignore special characters or symbols at the
    beginning of the line.

-   lowercase: This makes all the text lowercase. This property can also
    ignore special characters or symbols at the beginning of the line.

### text-underline-position

> The text-underline-position CSS property defines the location of the
> underline
>
> on elements that have the text-decoration property declared, and it
> looks like this:
>
> text-underline-position: left;

#### Description

> The text-underline-position property supports four keyword values:
> auto, left, right, and under.

##### auto

> This is the default value. This property allows the browser to decide
> where to place the underline, whether at the base line of the text or
> below it.

##### left {#left-2}

> This is only for vertical writing modes. It places the underline to
> the left of the text.

##### right {#right-2}

> This is only for vertical writing modes. It places the underline to
> the right of the text.
>
> []{#_bookmark213 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

##### under

> This value places the underline below the base line of the text, so it
> won\'t cross any descender (it supports values like q, p, y, and so
> on). This is helpful in text that has mathematical and chemical
> formulas that use a lot of subscripts, so the underline doesn\'t
> interfere with certain characters and make such formulas confusing or
> difficult to read.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> text-underline-position: left;
>
> }

### direction {#direction-1}

> The direction CSS property sets the direction of the text. Left to
> right for western languages and other similar languages and right to
> left for languages like Arabic or Hebrew. It looks like this:
>
> direction: rtl;

#### Description

> The text direction is typically defined in the HTML via the dir

>
> The direction CSS property is not inherited by table cells. So, in
> addition to this, it\'s recommended to set the direction of the text
> via the dir attribute in the HTML document to maintain complete
> cascading support if the CSS files do not load.
>
> This property accepts two keyword values, ltr and rtl, which mean
> *left to right* and
>
> *right to left*.

## Tables

> *Chapter 5*
>
> Tables, tables, tables! Together with images, HTML tables are the
> black sheep of web design.
>
> Regardless of being the black sheep, the power of tables is amazing.
> And if there\'s an HTML element that does its job well, very well,
> it\'s tables.
>
> Let\'s dig in.

### table-layout

> The table-layout CSS property allows us to define the how HTML tables
> are laid out on the document, and it looks like this:
>
> table-layout: fixed;

#### Description

> There are two keyword values: auto and fixed.

-   auto: This is the default value. Tables are automatically laid out
    by the browser this way without declaring anything in the CSS. The
    table cells adapt to the content inside of them; the behavior of
    table can sometimes be unpredictable.

-   fixed: By declaring the width of the table cells from the first row,
    the rendering of the entire table can be actually faster; anything
    we do to improve performance is big win for everyone.

> Since the table cells have a fixed width, depending on the data in the
> cells, some information can overflow the cells. Using a combination of
> the overflow properties and text-overflow: ellipsis; we can fix the
> issue.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> table {
>
> table-layout: fixed;
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark215 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

### border-collapse {#border-collapse-1}

> The border-collapse CSS property tells the table cells to stay
> separated or get close together (collapse), and it looks like this:
>
> border-collapse: collapse;

#### Description

> This property supports two keyword values: separate and collapse.

-   separate: This is the default value. There is a space between the
    table cells, and each cell has its own border.

-   collapse: This value brings the cells together, thus the space is
    lost and the cells share borders.

> **CSS**:
>
> table {
>
> border-collapse: collapse;
>
> }

### border-spacing {#border-spacing-1}

> The border-spacing CSS property creates a space between the table
> cells, and it looks like this:
>
> border-spacing: 10px;

#### Description

> The border-spacing property only works when the border-collapse:
> separate;
>
> declaration is present.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> table {
>
> border-collapse: separate;
>
> **border-spacing: 10px;**
>
> }

### empty-cells

> *Chapter 5*
>
> The empty-cells CSS property allows us to define how browsers should
> render borders and backgrounds on cells that have no content in them,
> and it looks like this:
>
> empty-cells: hide;

#### Description

> The empty-cells property supports two keyword values: show and hide,
> which determine whether the borders and background should, or should
> not, be rendered.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> table {
>
> empty-cells: hide;
>
> }

### caption-side

> The caption-side CSS property defines the location of the table
> caption, and it looks like this:
>
> caption-side: bottom;

#### Description

> It supports two keyword values: top and bottom.
>
> In CSS 2, other keyword values, such as left and right, were
> supported, but they were dropped in CSS 2.1.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> caption {
>
> caption-side: bottom;
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark217 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

## Words and paragraphs

> Continuing with typography features, we now enter the word and
> paragraph
>
> properties.
>
> Let\'s get going.

### hyphens {#hyphens-1}

> The hyphens CSS property tells the browser how to handle hyphenation
> when text lines wrap, and it looks like this:
>
> hyphens: auto;

#### Description

> We can control when to hyphenate and whether to allow it or let it
> happen under certain conditions.
>
> Hyphenation is language dependent. The language in a document is
> defined by the lang attribute; browsers will hyphenate if they support
> the language and a proper hyphenation dictionary is available. Each
> browser supports hyphenation differently.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image43.png){width="0.31995188101487315in"
> height="0.3996380139982502in"}Ensure that the lang attribute is
> declared either globally on the \<html\>
>
> tag or on the specific element whose content should be hyphenated.
>
> This property supports three keyword values: none, manual, and auto.

-   none: Text lines are not broken at line breaks even if there are
    characters suggesting where a line break should be introduced. Lines
    will only break on whitespace.

-   manual: Text lines are broken at line breaks where there are
    characters that suggest a line break.

-   auto: The browser makes the decision to introduce line breaks as it
    seem necessary. It bases its decisions on either the presence of
    hyphenation characters or by language-specific information.

[]{#_bookmark218 .anchor}*Chapter 5*

##### Unicode characters to suggest line break opportunities

> There are two Unicode characters that we can use to manually set a
> potential line break in the text:
>
> U+2010 (HYPHEN)
>
> This character is called a **hard** hyphen. It\'s an actual hyphen
> \"-\" and it\'s visible in the
>
> text. The browser may or may not break the line on that specific
> character.
>
> U+00AD (SHY)
>
> This character is called a **soft** hyphen. Although it is present in
> the markup, it is not rendered in the text. However, the browser
> *sees* this character and, if it can use it to create a line break, it
> will. To insert a soft hyphen, we use &shy;.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { hyphens: auto;
>
> }

### word-break {#word-break-1}

> The word-break CSS property is used to specify whether line breaks
> should happen within words instead of breaking the lines on a hyphen
> or a space between words, and it looks like this:
>
> word-break: break-all;

#### Description

> The word-break property is very helpful in situations where a long
> string, such as a URL, is wider than its parent container, thus
> disrupting the layout or bleeding off the side. Applying the
> word-break property makes the URL break somewhere along the string.
>
> This property supports three keyword values: normal, break-all, and
> keep-all.

##### normal

> This is the default value. Line breaks will happen based on default
> line breaking rules.
>
> []{#_bookmark219 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

##### break-all

> This allows line breaks to happen anywhere, including between two
> letters.

##### keep-all

> This affects CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) text only. Here, text
> words are not broken.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> word-break: break-all;
>
> }

### word-spacing {#word-spacing-1}

> The word-spacing CSS property controls the space between words, and it
> looks like this:
>
> word-spacing: .2em;

#### Description

> It supports the following values: a normal value, a length value and a
> percentage
>
> value.

##### normal

> This is the default value. It\'s defined by the current font or the
> browser itself, and it
>
> resets to the default spacing.

##### Length value

> We use one of the following units when we use a length value: px, em,
> in, mm, cm, vw, and so on

##### Percentage value

> For a percentage value, we use percentages like 50%, 85%, and so on.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> word-spacing: .2em;
>
> }

### word-wrap

> *Chapter 5*
>
> The word-wrap CSS property allows long words to break at an arbitrary
> point if there are no suggested break points in the long word in
> question, and it looks like this:
>
> empty-cells: hide;

#### Description

> This property supports two keyword values: normal and break-word.

-   normal: It makes long words break at normal break points

-   break-word: It indicates that otherwise unbreakable words can now
    break at an arbitrary point

> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> word-wrap: break-word;
>
> }

### line-height

> The line-height CSS property defines the distance between lines of
> text. In typography, the line height is called **leading**.

#### Description

> It supports the following values: a normal value, a number value, a
> length value, and a percentage value.

-   normal: This is the default value. The line height is defined by the
    browser.

-   Number value: This is a number without any unit. This is the
    recommended method. The reason a unitless value is recommended is
    because this value can cascade into child elements. Child elements
    can then scale their line height based on their font size.

-   Length value: We use one of the following units when we use the
    length value: px, em, in, mm, cm, vw, and so on. We can use decimals
    as well.

-   Percentage value: For the percentage value, we use percentages like
    50%, 85%, and so on.

> []{#_bookmark221 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> line-height: 1.6;
>
> }

### orphans {#orphans-1}

> Let\'s understand the term **orphans** first. Orphans are the lines of
> a paragraph left in the previous page when a block of text is split
> over two pages. In the Web world, this is seen in text that spans
> several columns, where the first line of a paragraph is left on the
> previous column.
>
> From an editorial standpoint, this is very bad. The recommended
> treatment of orphans is to leave at least three lines on the previous
> page or column. The more lines, the better.
>
> The orphans CSS property controls the number of lines left on the
> previous page, and it looks like this:
>
> orphans: 3;

#### Description

> This property is very useful in print stylesheets, but it can also
> work when using CSS columns.
>
> It supports a *numeric* value without a unit. This numeric value
> defines the number
>
> of lines left on the previous page or column.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Print stylesheet\*/ \@media print {
>
> .element { orphans: 3;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> /\*Screen stylesheet\*/
>
> .element { orphans: 4;
>
> }

### quotes

> *Chapter 5*
>
> The quotes CSS property controls the types of quotation marks to use,
> and it looks like this:
>
> quotes: \"\"\" \"\"\" \"\'\" \"\'\";

#### Description

> Quotation marks are added via the :before and :after pseudo-elements.
>
> The simplest way to add quotation marks is to let the browser do it
> using the content property and the open-quote and close-quote values:
> content: open-quote; and content: close-quote;.
>
> We can also declare the types of quotes we want to use and not let the
> browser decide. We\'ll see this in the following CSS example.
>
> Quotes always start and end with a double-character symbol, either \"
> \" or, for example, « » in French. But, if there\'s a nested quote,
> this nested quote uses a single- character symbol, either \' \' or,
> for example, ‹ › in French.
>
> This property supports two values: none and a \[string string\] value.

##### none

> No quotation marks are generated when using the content property.

##### \[string string +\] value

> Each string represents a pair of quotes. The first string represents
> the outer level quotation marks and the second string represents the
> nested level quotation marks.
>
> The + sign means that we can add deeper levels of nested quotation
> marks, but it\'s not really necessary, two levels should work for most
> cases.
>
> Taking into account these considerations, we can then create the
> following quotation marks with the quotes property:
>
> CSS:/\*Quotation marks inserted by the browser \" \" and \' \'\*/
> p:before { content: open-quote; }
>
> p:after { content: close-quote; }
>
> /\*Custom declared quotation marks\*/ p { quotes: \"\"\" \"\"\" \"\'\"
> \"\'\"; }
>
> /\*French quotation marks\*/
>
> p { quotes: \"«\" \"»\" \"‹\" \"›\"; }
>
> []{#_bookmark223 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

### widows {#widows-1}

> Let\'s clarify the term **widows** first. Widows are the lines of a
> paragraph that appear on the next page when a block of text is split
> over two pages. In the Web world, this is seen in text that spans
> several columns, where the last line of a paragraph appears on the
> next column.
>
> From an editorial standpoint, this is very bad. The recommended
> treatment of widows is to leave at least three lines on the next page
> or column. The more lines, the better.
>
> The widows CSS property controls the number of lines that will appear
> on the next page, and it looks like this:
>
> widows: 3;

#### Description

> The widows property is very useful in print stylesheets, but it can
> also work when using CSS columns.
>
> It supports a *numeric* value without a unit. This numeric value
> defines the amount of
>
> lines that will appear on the next page or column.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Print stylesheet\*/ \@media print {
>
> .element { widows: 3;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> /\*Screen stylesheet\*/
>
> .element { widows: 4;
>
> }

### writing-mode {#writing-mode-1}

> The writing-mode CSS property defines the direction in which lines of
> text or even block-level elements are laid out, either vertically or
> horizontally, and it looks like this:
>
> writing-mode: vertical-rl;

#### Description

> *Chapter 5*
>
> This property supports three keyword values: horizontal-tb,
> vertical-rl, and
>
> vertical-lr.

##### horizontal-tb

> This means *horizontal*, *from top to bottom*. The content flows from
> left to right, top to
>
> bottom.

##### vertical-rl

> This means *vertical*, *from right to left*. The content is turned 90
> degrees and flows
>
> vertically.
>
> To understand this better, think of this: tilt your head to the right
> shoulder, at this point, you will be able to read the text flow from
> top (which was to the right before tilting your head) to bottom (which
> was to the left before tilting your head).

##### vertical-lr

> This means *vertical*, *from left to right*. The content is turned 90
> degrees and flows
>
> vertically.
>
> However, unlike vertical-rl, when you tilt your head over your right
> shoulder, the content flows from bottom (which was to the left before
> tilting your head) to top (which was to the right before tilting your
> head), and the text lines are inverted.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> writing-mode: vertical-rl;
>
> }

### letter-spacing

> The letter-spacing CSS property defines the space between the
> characters in a line of text, and it looks like this:
>
> letter-spacing: 5px;

#### Description

> The letter-spacing property supports the keyword values: normal and
> length. Negative values are valid.
>
> []{#_bookmark225 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image44.png){width="0.31994422572178477in"
> height="0.39964129483814526in"}Unless you understand the legibility
> and design implications, the default letter spacing in most fonts is
> ideal and should rarely be changed.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> letter-spacing: 5px;
>
> }

### white-space {#white-space-1}

> The white-space CSS property defines how the whitespace inside an
> element is going to be treated, and it looks like this:
>
> white-space: pre-wrap;

#### Description

> This property supports five keyword values: normal, nowrap, pre,
> pre-wrap, and
>
> pre-line.

##### normal

> This is the default value. If we have two or more spaces together,
> they will collapse into a single space. This is the normal behavior of
> HTML documents. It will wrap the text where necessary.

##### nowrap

> Multiple spaces will collapse into a single space, and the line will
> never wrap except if there\'s a \<br\> tag in the markup.

##### pre {#pre-2}

> It\'s the same as the HTML element \<pre\>, which means
> **preformatted**. This value will honor all spaces in the text, but
> will not wrap it unless there\'s a \<br\> tag in the markup, just like
> nowrap does. This value is great to display short chunks of code.

##### pre-wrap

> This value honors all the spaces and will wrap the text where
> necessary. This value is great to display long chunks of code.

##### pre-line

> *Chapter 5*
>
> This value collapses multiple spaces into a single space and will wrap
> the text where necessary.

### tab-size

> The tab-size CSS property allows us to define the number of spaces the
> tab
>
> character can have.
>
> As we saw in the prior white-space property description, multiple
> spaces are collapsed into a single space by default. Therefore, this
> property will only work on elements that are inside a \<pre\> tag or,
> have one of the white-space properties that honor multiple spaces, pre
> and pre-wrap.
>
> This property is great for displaying code.
>
> The default number of spaces the tab character has is 8. But we, web
> designers and developers, are picky and like either four spaces or
> sometimes two. With the tab-size property, we can modify that default
> value to anything we want.

#### Description

> The tab-size property supports two values: A numeric value and a
> length value.

-   **Numeric value**: It\'s just a number without a unit. Negative
    values are not valid.

-   **Length value**: We use one of the following units when we use the
    length value: px, em, in, mm, cm, vw, and so on.

> **CSS**:
>
> pre {
>
> white-space: pre-wrap;
>
> **tab-size: 4;**
>
> }

## Paging

> Although we build sites and applications for the Web, sometimes what
> we make is also printed.
>
> The following properties will help us make our content more
> presentable and better handled across pages when printed.
>
> Let\'s check out these paging properties.
>
> []{#_bookmark227 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 2]{.underline}*

### page-break-after {#page-break-after-1}

> The page-break-after CSS property defines where the page breaks after
> a specific
>
> element, and it looks like this:
>
> page-break-after: always;

#### Description

> What this means is that when a new page break is created, a new page
> will be printed.
>
> It works only on block-level elements. Also, since this property is
> used for printing, it\'s common to see it inside an \@print media
> query.
>
> This property supports five keyword values: always, auto, avoid, left,
> and right.

-   always: This value will force a page break after the element.

-   auto: This is the default value. It creates automatic page breaks.

-   avoid: This will not allow any page breaks after the element, if
    possible.

-   left: This will force one or two page breaks after the element in
    order to make the following page a left-side page.

-   right: This will force one or two page breaks after the element in
    order to make the following page a right-side page.

> **CSS**:
>
> \@media print {
>
> .element {
>
> page-break-after: always;
>
> }
>
> }

### page-break-before {#page-break-before-1}

> The page-break-before CSS property works similar to the
> page-break-after CSS property. However, it defines where the page
> breaks before a specific element, and it looks like this:
>
> page-break-before: always;

[]{#_bookmark228 .anchor}*Chapter 5*

#### Description

> When a new page break is created, a new page will be printed.
>
> It works only on block-level elements. Also, since this property is
> used for printing, it\'s common to see it inside an \@print media
> query.
>
> This property supports the same five keyword values as the
> page-break-before
>
> property: always, auto, avoid, left, and right.
>
> Refer to the page-break-before CSS property section for the
> description of each keyword value.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> \@media print {
>
> .element {
>
> page-break-before: always;
>
> }
>
> }

### page-break-inside {#page-break-inside-1}

> The page-break-inside CSS property also works similar to the
>
> page-break-before and page-break-after properties. However, it defines
> where the page breaks inside a specific element, and it looks like
> this:
>
> page-break-inside: avoid;

#### Description

> What this means is that when a new page break is created, a new page
> will be printed.
>
> This property supports only two keyword values, though: auto and
> avoid.

-   auto: This is the default value. It creates automatic page breaks.

-   avoid: This will not allow any page breaks inside the element, if
    possible.

> **CSS**:
>
> \@media print {
>
> .element {wdwqd

# CSS Properties -- Part 3

> Now that we\'re done with Part 2 of the CSS properties, let\'s end
> strongly with Part 3. Let\'s do this.

## Page box

> The page box is a square/rectangular area built out of two parts: the
> *page area* and the *margin area*.
>
> The page area is where the content sits and all elements are laid out.
> The margin area sits around the page area and is transparent. If we
> add a background color to the page area, it will cover the page area
> and the margin area.
>
> The size of the page box cannot be modified. But if we plan to modify
> some of the
>
> page box properties, we need to include them in an \@page rule. Let\'s
> check it out.

### bleed {#bleed-1}

> The bleed CSS property is also called the *CSS at-rule descriptor*. It
> defines how much a page should \"*overflow*\" or bleed outside the
> page box. This property only works if marks have been enabled using
> the marks property, which we\'ll see next.
>
> []{#_bookmark230 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*

#### Description

> The bleed property only supports a length value: px, em, in, mm, cm,
> vw, and so on.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> \@page { bleed: 5mm;
>
> }

### marks {#marks-1}

> The marks CSS property, also called a *CSS at-rule descriptor*,
> defines the types of mark that should be rendered and printed outside
> the page box.
>
> Since the marks are printed outside the page box, the pages need to be
> a bit larger in order to have the space to print the marks.

#### Description

> The marks property supports three keyword values: crop, cross, and
> none.

-   crop: Crop marks define where the page should be cut

-   cross: Cross marks are used to align the pages

-   none: Marks will not be displayed

> **CSS**:
>
> \@page {
>
> marks: crop cross;
>
> }

## List {#list-2}

> CSS lists are one of the most versatile elements of web design. Aside
> from being used for making, well, lists, they are also used for
> navigation, layouts, slideshows, carousels, and so on.
>
> Let\'s see some of their properties.

### list-style

> *Chapter 6*
>
> The list-style CSS property is shorthand for the list-style-type,
> list-style- image, and list-style-position properties. These
> properties are actually the values that the list-style CSS property
> supports. We\'ll see all these properties next.

#### Description

> The list-style property supports one, two, or three values, in any
> order. If a value isn\'t declared, it will use its default value.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Default values\*/
>
> ul { list-style: disc outside none; }
>
> /\*One value, the other two are default\*/ ul { list-style: circle; }
>
> /\*Two values, the other one is defaults\*/ ul { list-style:
> lower-roman inside; }
>
> /\*Three values\*/
>
> ul { list-style: decimal outside url(../images/list-bullet.png); }

### list-style-type

> The list-style-type CSS property defines the type of graphic or marker
> (also called **bullet**) the list will use. The color of the marker is
> determined by the color of the text of the element it\'s applied to.

#### Description

> The list-style-type property supports many values, but we\'ll list 15
> of the most commonly used ones: armenian, circle, decimal,
> decimal-leading-zero, disc, georgian, lower-alpha, lower-greek,
> lower-latin, lower-roman, none, square, upper-alpha, upper-latin, and
> upper-roman.
>
> []{#_bookmark232 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*
>
> Here\'s a screenshot with all values except the none value:

![](./images-ref/media/image45.png)

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Style: 01, 02, 03\...\*/
>
> ul { list-style-type: decimal-leading-zero; }
>
> /\*Style: α, β, γ\...\*/
>
> ul { list-style-type: lower-greek; }
>
> /\*Style: A, B, C\...\*/
>
> ul { list-style-type: upper-latin; }

### list-style-position {#list-style-position-1}

> The list-style-position CSS property defines the location of the
> marker.

#### Description

> The list-style-position property supports two keyword values: inside
> and
>
> outside.

##### inside

> When the inside value is applied, the marker will appear inside the
> text. If there\'s a line that wraps, the marker will be flushed to the
> left and not \"*sticking out*\" like in traditional lists.

[]{#_bookmark233 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

##### outside

> The default value is outside. When this value is applied (or not,
> since it\'s the
>
> default), the marker will appear outside the text. If there\'s a line
> that wraps, the marker will be outside the text block. It will
> \"*stick out*\" just like in traditional lists.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> ul {
>
> list-style-position: inside;
>
> }

### list-style-image {#list-style-image-1}

> The list-style-image CSS property allows us to replace the default
> markers with a custom image.

#### Description

> The list-style-image property supports one keyword value and one
> function:
>
> none and url().

-   none: No image is used to replace the marker

-   url(): It\'s used to define the path to the image that will replace
    the marker

> **CSS**:
>

## Counter

> Traditional lists via the \<ul\>, \<ol\>, \<dl\> tags aren\'t too
> versatile when it comes to styling the markers. Sometimes, we have to
> rely on extra markup to accomplish some minimal custom styling.
>
> CSS counters, on the other hand, take styling lists (or any element
> for that matter) to a whole new level of customization and styling.
>
> Granted, CSS counters rely not only on the properties we\'re going to
> see next, but also on the content property and the :before
> pseudo-element.
>
> Let\'s check out the properties that make CSS counters so great.
>
> []{#_bookmark234 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*

### counter-reset {#counter-reset-1}

> The counter-reset CSS property resets the counter by giving it a name,
> and it looks like this:
>
> counter-reset: basic-counter;

#### Description

> The counter-reset property serves two purposes: resets the counter and
> defines a name for the counter. The name is later used by the
> counter-increment and counter()/counters() functions that we\'ll see
> later.
>
> I have to admit that the term \"counter-reset\" isn\'t as intuitive as
> it should be if it\'s used to set a name for the counter. Something
> like \"counter-name\" would be more suitable if you ask me.
>
> This property supports two values: a *name* and a *number*.
>
> We can reference multiple counter resets in the same declaration.

##### name {#name-2}

> We need to give the reset counter a name. This value is required. It
> can be any name but it needs to adhere to the following conditions:

-   It can start with a letter, an underscore \"\_\", or a hyphen \"-\"

-   It can start with a hyphen \"-\" character but cannot have two
    consecutive hyphens at the beginning of the name

-   The name cannot be just a hyphen\"-\"; at least one more character
    is required, but it can\'t be a number since it would be interpreted
    as \"minus 1\" (-1)

-   It cannot start with a number or a special character like #, \$, !,
    and so on

##### number

> It\'s the number that the counter is reset to. The default value is 0
> (zero) if no value is declared.
>
> This value is optional unless we want to start the list from a number
> different than
>
> 1\. Pay close attention to this value, because the first number in the
> list is not the
>
> number declared in this value.
>
> If we set the value to 1, the list starts at 2. If we leave the value
> empty, it defaults to 0
>
> (zero) and the list starts at 1. Negative values are valid.

[]{#_bookmark235 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Define a name and counter reset to 0\*/ ul { counter-reset:
> basic-counter; }
>
> /\*The counter will start at 3\*/
>
> ul { counter-reset: basic-counter 2; }
>
> /\*Multiple counters in a single declaration\*/
>
> ul { counter-reset: basic-counter-A, basic-counter-B 2; }

### counter-increment {#counter-increment-1}

> The counter-increment CSS property increments the value of one or more
> counters, and it looks like this:
>
> **counter-increment:** basic-counter **2**;

#### Description

> This property is used with the counter-reset CSS property. This is
> because the name specified in the counter-reset property is used in
> the counter-increment CSS property.
>
> As a refresher, remember that the counter name will also be used by
> the counter()/ counters() function.
>
> We can declare multiple counter increments in the same declaration.
> Multiple counters are separated by a space. This property supports two
> values: A *name* and a *number*.

##### name {#name-3}

> It can be any name but it needs to adhere to the following conditions:

-   It can start with a letter, an underscore \"\_\", or a hyphen \"-\"

-   It can start with a hyphen \"-\" character but not have two
    consecutive hyphens at the beginning of the name

-   The name cannot be just the hyphen\"-\"; at least one more character
    is required, but it can\'t be a number since it would be interpreted
    as \"minus 1\" (-1).

-   It cannot start with a number or a special character like #, \$, !,
    and so on.

##### number

> This is the number that the counter is reset to. The default value is
> 0 (zero) if no value is declared. This value is optional unless we
> want to start the list from a number different than 1.
>
> Now, the number value defines the amount of increments each counter
> will have. For example, if we declare 2, then the counter will be 2,
> 4, 6, and so on. If we declare 3, then the counter will be 3, 6, 9,
> and so on.
>
> If we do not declare a value, the default increment will be by 1, as
> in 1, 2, 3, and so on.
>
> Negative values are valid. If we declare -2, then the counter will be
> -2, -4, -6, and so on.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*First, define a name and counter reset to 0 with counter-reset\*/
> ul { counter-reset: basic-counter; }
>
> /\*Then, invoque the counter name and increment every element by 2 (2,

## Drop shadows

> There are three ways to create the effect of depth: using lights,
> shadows, or both. Let\'s see how we create box shadows for our
> containers.

### box-shadow {#box-shadow-1}

> The box-shadow CSS property creates one or several shadows on an
> element, and it looks like this:
>
> box-shadow: 10px 10px 13px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5) inset;

[]{#_bookmark237 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

#### Description

> The box-shadow property supports three, four, five, or six values in
> the same
>
> declaration: four *length* values, one *color* value, and the
> *keyword* inset.

##### Length values

> We use one of the following units when we use the length values: px,
> em, in, mm, cm, vw, and so on.
>
> The four length values are as follows:

-   The first value is for the horizontal offset of the shadow. Negative
    values are valid. This value is required.

-   The second value is for the vertical offset of the shadow. Negative
    values are valid. This value is required.

-   The third value is for the blur radius of the shadow. The larger the
    value, the more spread the shadow becomes, but also more
    translucent. Negative values are not valid. This value is required.

-   The fourth value is for the size of the shadow (or \"spread
    radius\"). Negative values are valid. This value is optional.

##### Color value

> This is the fifth value in the list. It supports all color modes: HEX,
> RGB, RGBa, HSL, HSLs, and *color name*.
>
> This value is optional. If no color is specified, it\'s up to the
> browser to decide which color to use. Some browsers may not even
> display a shadow at all without a color value.
>
> The *color* value can go either at the beginning or at the end of the
> declaration but never between the length values; otherwise, the
> box-shadow property won\'t work.

##### inset

> The sixth value in the list is inset. It creates the shadow inside the
> container, like a background. However, if there is actually a
> background color or image, the inset shadow will sit on top of it but
> under the content without affecting the layout of the child elements
> of the container.
>
> []{#_bookmark238 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*
>
> This value is optional. If this value is not declared, the shadow
> defaults to displaying the shadow outside the element.
>
> This value can go either at the beginning or at the end of the
> declaration but never between the length values; otherwise, the
> box-shadow property won\'t work.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Left 10px, top 10px, blur 13px, spread 5px, RGBa mode, inside the
> element\*/
>
> .element {
>
> box-shadow: 10px 10px 13px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5) inset;
>
> }

## Display and visibility

> Display properties are some of the most widely used CSS features in
> web design and development.
>
> Let\'s check them out.

### all {#all-1}

> The all CSS property resets an element\'s properties to its default
> values, and it looks like this:
>
> all: initial;

#### Description

> The only properties that are not reset are the direction and
> unicode-bidi properties, which control text direction. This is
> important because text direction is required to understand the
> content. If these properties were reset by the all property, then text
> would run the opposite way it\'s supposed to, disrupting the message
> completely.
>
> []{#_bookmark239 .anchor}This property supports three keyword values:
> initial, inherit, and unset.
>
> *Chapter 6*

-   initial: This changes all the properties of the element or the
    element\'s parent to their initial values.

-   inherit: This changes all the properties of the element or the
    element\'s parent to their parent values.

-   unset: This changes all the properties of the element or the
    element\'s parent to their parent values if those properties are
    inheritable, otherwise it will change them to their initial value.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Change an element\'s properties to their initial value\*/
>
> .element { all: initial; }
>
> /\*Inherit all the initial properties of the parent container\*/
>
> .element { all: inherit; }
>
> /\*Change the parent\'s properties to its parent values if
> inheritable\*/
>
> .parent-container { all: unset; }

### clear {#clear-1}

> The clear CSS property specifies which side of an element, or both,
> should not *float*, and it looks like this:
>
> clear: both;

#### Description

> When the clear property is used, it clears the specific box in
> question, not its child elements. If we wanted to clear its child
> elements, we\'d have to declare the clear property on them.
>
> When dealing with float-based grids, this property is crucial to the
> layout. That is because floated elements are taken out of the document
> flow. Thus, their parent container will not take them into account and
> its height isn\'t determined by those floated elements anymore.
>
> []{#_bookmark240 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*
>
> So, adding a clearing declaration (with the display and content
> properties) to the parent\'s :after pseudo element \"*tells*\" the
> parent element to consider the floated elements and thus the parent
> container\'s height is now determined by the tallest floating child
> element. Let\'s take a look at the following image:

![](./images-ref/media/image46.png)

> Here is a demo in CodePen: <http://tiny.cc/clearing-floats>
>
> The clear CSS property supports four values: left, right, both, and
> none.

-   left: It means that floated elements to the left are not allowed.

-   right: It means that floated elements to the right are not allowed.

-   both: It means that floated elements, both left and right, are not
    allowed.

-   none: This is the default value. No clearing is performed and
    floating elements to both sides are allowed.

[]{#_bookmark241 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Float an element to the left\*/
>
> .element-a { float: left; }
>
> /\*Float an element to the right\*/
>
> .element-b { float: right; }
>
> /\*Clear the floats on the parent container\*/
>
> .parent-container:after { content: \'\';
>
> display: table; clear: both;
>
> }

### display {#display-1}

> The display CSS property defines how an element (box) should be or
> should not be displayed on a page. It looks like this:
>
> display: block;

#### Description

> This property accepts about 25 keyword values; some of them are very
> obscure and rarely used. Let\'s focus on the 15 most relevant ones:

-   block

-   flex

-   grid

-   inline

-   inline-block

-   inline-flex

-   none

-   table

-   table-cell

-   table-column

-   table-column-group

-   table-footer-group

-   table-header-group

-   table-row

-   table-row-group

> []{#_bookmark242 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*

-   block: Makes an element be displayed as a block-level element, like
    a \<div\>

> tag or an \<h1\> element.

-   flex: Makes an element be displayed as a block-level element and
    lays out its content based on the Flexbox model.

-   grid: Makes an element be displayed as a block-level element and
    lays out its content based on the Grid model.

-   inline: Makes an element be displayed as an inline-level element,
    like a link

> \<a\> element.

-   inline-block: Makes an element be displayed as an inline-block
    element, like a list \<li\> element.

-   inline-flex: Makes an element be displayed as an inline element and
    lays out its content based on the Flexbox model.

-   none: Hides the element from rendering in the browser. The element
    still exists in the markup though. When this value is applied to an
    element, the browser does not render the element and all its
    children.

##### Table-related values

> In the following list, all the table-related values are mapped to an
> HTML element. So when any of those values are applied to an element,
> they make that element behave as a table-related element. Let\'s take
> a look at the attributes:

-   table = \<table\>

-   table-cell = \<td\>

-   table-column = \<col\>

-   table-column-group = \<colgroup\>

-   table-footer-group = \<tfoot\>

-   table-header-group = \<thead\>

-   table-row = \<tr\>

-   table-row-group = \<tbody\>

> Visit MDN for a list of all the display values:
> <http://tiny.cc/mdn-display>

[]{#_bookmark243 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Make an element display like a block level element\*/
>
> .element { display: block; }
>
> /\*Make an element display like a \<table\> element\*/
>
> .element { display: table; }
>
> /\*Make an element display like an inline-block element - \<li\>\*/
>
> .element { display: inline-block; }
>
> /\*Hide an element an its children\*/
>
> .element { display: none; }

### opacity {#opacity-1}

> The opacity CSS property defines the transparency (opacity) of an
> element, and it
>
> looks like this:
>
> opacity: .55;

#### Description

> When the opacity property is applied to an element, the element itself
> and its children are affected.
>
> This property supports a *numeric* value ranging from 0.0 (zero) to
> 1.0, which is the default value. A value of 0 is completely
> transparent, as in 0 percent opaque, and 1 is 100 percent opaque, no
> transparency whatsoever. Decimal numbers are allowed.
>
> This property behaves the same as the alpha channel value used in the
> RGBa and HSLa color modes.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Make an element 55% opaque. This affects its children as well\*/
>
> .element { opacity: .55; }
>
> /\*Makes shadow 20% opaque. Same effect as in RGBa and HSLa color

>
> .element { box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, **.2**); }
>
> []{#_bookmark244 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*

### filter {#filter-1}

> The filter CSS property allows us to apply visual effects to an img
> element or to the
>
> background or border properties, and it looks like this:
>
> filter: blur(10px);

#### Description

> A few examples of CSS filters are blur, turning a color image into
> grayscale or sepia,
>
> or changing its opacity.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image47.png){width="0.31994641294838144in"
> height="0.3996522309711286in"}This filter property is not the same as
> Microsoft\'s proprietary filter property that only IE supports. Unlike
> Microsoft\'s proprietary filters, which are not part of a standard,
> this CSS filter property is part of a work in progress of the W3C.
>
> This property supports 11 values. These values are called CSS
> functions. Multiple functions can be declared in the same selector,
> separated by a space.
>
> Let\'s see the list:

-   blur()

-   brightness()

-   contrast()

-   drop-shadow()

-   grayscale()

-   hue-rotate()

-   invert()

-   opacity()

-   saturate()

-   sepia()

-   url()

##### blur()

> This gives a **smudge** effect. Values are declared as *length* values
> (px, em, in, mm, cm, vw
>
> and so on). The higher the value, the more intense the blur effect is
> (and vice versa). Percentage and negative values are not allowed, but
> decimal values are allowed.

[]{#_bookmark245 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

##### brightness()

> This modifies the illumination of an image. Values are declared as
> either a
>
> *percentage* or a *number* without a unit, for example, 10% and 0.5%.
>
> A value of 100% leaves the element unchanged, and a value of 0% makes
> the element completely black. Values over 100% are allowed and create
> a more intense effect.
>
> There is no limit to the value.
>
> Then, a value of 1 leaves the element unchanged; a value of 0 makes
> the element completely black. Values over 1 are allowed and create a
> more intense effect. There is no limit to the value. Negative values
> are not valid.

##### contrast()

> This modifies the contrast of an element. Values are declared as
> either a *percentage*
>
> or a *number* without a unit, for example, 10% and 0.5%.
>
> A value of 100% leaves the element unchanged, and a value of 0% makes

> the element completely black. Values over 1 are allowed and create a
> more intense effect. There is no limit to the value. Negative values
> are not valid, and decimal values are allowed.

##### drop-shadow()

> This adds a shadow under the element.
>
> This function works almost exactly the same way as the box-shadow
> property with two differences: the drop-shadow() function doesn\'t
> support the spread-radius attribute or the inset values.
>
> Please refer to the box-shadow property for a detailed description of
> all the values.
>
> Additionally, some browsers actually provide hardware acceleration
> when using this function, which eventually improves performance. You
> know how it goes, anything we can do to improve performance is always
> a+1.

##### grayscale()

> This converts an element to grayscale. Values are declared as either a
> *percentage* or a
>
> *number* without a unit, for example, 10% and 0.5%.
>
> A value of 0% leaves the element unchanged; a value of 100% makes the
> element grayscale. Values over 100% are not allowed.
>
> []{#_bookmark246 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*
>
> A value of 0 leaves the element unchanged, and a value of 1 makes the
> element grayscale. Values over 1 are not allowed. Negative values are
> not valid, and decimal values are allowed.

##### hue-rotate()

> This applies a hue rotation to the element. It accepts an *angle*
> value.
>
> The angle value defines the degrees around the color wheel the element
> sample will be modified to. There isn\'t a maximum value, however, if
> the value is larger than 360deg, the rotation will just go around. For
> example, if we declare 380deg, that would the same as 20deg.

##### invert()

> The invert() function inverts the color of the element. If used in an
> image, it makes
>
> the image look like a film negative.
>
> A value of 100% completely inverts the element\'s color; a value of 0%
> leaves the element unchanged. Values over 100% are not allowed.
>
> A value of 1 completely inverts the element\'s color, and a value of 0
> leaves the element unchanged. Values over 1 are not allowed.
>
> Negative values are not valid, and decimal values are allowed.

##### opacity() {#opacity-2}

> It defines the transparency (opacity) of an element. When this
> function is applied to an element, the element itself and its children
> are affected.
>
> This function supports a numeric value ranging from 0 (zero) to 1,
> which is the default value. A value of 0 is completely transparent, as
> in 0% opaque, and 1 is 100% opaque, no transparency whatsoever.
>
> Negative values are not valid, and decimal values are allowed.

##### saturate()

> It affects the saturation levels of an element. Values are declared as
> either a
>
> *percentage* or a *number* without a unit, for example, 10% and 0.5%.
>
> The default saturation value of an element is 100%, or 1 if using a
> unitless number.
>
> A value of 0% completely desaturates the element (it removes all color
> leaving the element in grayscale); a value of 100% leaves the element
> unchanged. Values over 100% are allowed, creating a more intense
> effect.

[]{#_bookmark247 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

> A value of 0 completely desaturates the element (it removes all color
> leaving the element in grayscale), and a value of 1 leaves the element
> unchanged. Values over 1 are allowed, creating a more intense effect.

##### sepia()

> This converts an element to sepia---think of a grayscale image but in
> shades of brown.
>
> A value of 100% completely turns the element to sepia; a value of 0%
> leaves the element unchanged. Values over 100% are not allowed.
>
> A value of 1 completely turns the element to sepia; a value of 0
> leaves the element unchanged. Values over 1 are not allowed. Negative

### overflow {#overflow-1}

> The overflow CSS property defines how a block level element should
> handle content
>
> that \"*bleeds*\" (overflows) outside its boundaries, and it looks
> like this:
>
> overflow: auto;

#### Description

> A peculiarity of the overflow property is that it is used to clear
> floats and make the parent container expand vertically to wrap the
> floating elements. This is accomplished by using any of the following
> values except visible.
>
> However, a word of caution. When using the prior technique since it
> can have unforeseen effects. For example, if a child element has a
> box-shadow, the shadow could be clipped/hidden.
>
> In order for content to overflow, the parent container needs to have a
> fixed height or
>
> the content needs to have a white-space: nowrap; declaration applied
> to it.
>
> This property supports four keyword values: auto, hidden, scroll, and
> visible.

-   auto: This creates horizontal and vertical scrollbars only if
    necessary. In other words, if the content overflows the container in
    any direction, the browser will create scrollbars in one or both
    axes.

-   hidden: This will clip/hide the content that\'s outside of the
    element. No scrollbars are generated. This value is very popular
    when clearing floats. Again, be careful when using this value.

-   scroll: This creates horizontal and vertical scrollbars even if the
    content isn\'t overflowing the container.

-   visible: This is the default value. No content is clipped/hidden and
    no scrollbars are generated.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Scroll bars are generated if the content needs them\*/
>
> .element {
>
> white-space: nowrap;
>
> **overflow: auto;**
>
> }
>
> /\*Clearing floats. Be careful with this technique\*/
>
> .parent-container { **overflow: hidden;** }

### overflow-x

> *Chapter 6*
>
> The overflow-x CSS property behaves the same as the overflow property,
> and it looks like this:
>
> overflow-x: auto;

#### Description

> The difference is that the overflow-x property handles the overflow on
> the *X* axis (horizontally). Please refer to the description of
> overflow, since the values are the same.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> white-space: nowrap;
>
> **overflow-x: auto;**
>
> }

### overflow-y

> The overflow-y CSS property behaves like the overflow property, and it
> looks like this:
>
> overflow-y: auto;

#### Description

> The difference is that the overflow-y property handles the overflow on
> the *Y* axis (vertically). Please refer to the prior description of
> overflow, since the values are the same.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { height: 100px;
>
> **overflow-y: auto;**
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark250 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*

### visibility {#visibility-1}

> The visibility CSS property defines whether an element is visible or
> not, and it
>
> looks like this:
>
> visibility: hidden;

#### Description

> The visibility property is similar to display: none; in terms of
> hiding an element; the difference is that when hiding an element with
> the visibility property, the space the element occupies still affects
> the layout. It\'s just \"*invisible*\". With display: none;, it\'s
> like the element doesn\'t even exist.
>
> The visibility CSS property is not inheritable; in other words, we can
> still make the child elements visible even if their parent container
> is not. It can also be used to hide rows and columns in tables.
>
> This property supports three different keyword values: collapse,
> hidden, and
>
> visible.

-   collapse: This is used only on table elements to remove rows or
    columns. However, the collapsed/hidden elements still affect the
    layout since they are still taking up their space. If this value is
    used in other elements than a table elements, they will be treated
    as if the value hidden is being used.

-   hidden: This is used to visually hide an element. However, any
    hidden elements still affect the layout because they are still
    taking up their space.

-   visible: This is the default value. It makes an element visible.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Hide an element\*/
>
> .element { visibility: hidden; }
>
> /\*Parent container visible while child heading is visible\*/
>
> .parent-container { visibility: hidden; }
>
> .parent-container h1 { visibility: visible; }
>
> /\*Hide table elements\*/
>
> tr { visibility: collapse; } tfoot { visibility: collapse; }

### z-index

> *Chapter 6*
>
> The z-index CSS property defines the stacking order of elements. Think
> of it in this way: elements sometimes overlap, like a stack of poker
> cards on a table. The card sitting at the top of the stack has the
> highest z-index, the card sitting at the bottom has the lowest
> z-index.
>
> For this property to work, the element has to have a position property
> declared with any value different from static.

#### Description

> The z-index property accepts two values: a *number* and a *keyword*
> value.

-   **Number value**: This is also called an \"**integer**\". It\'s just
    a number without a unit.

-   **auto**: This is the default value. The stacking order of elements
    is the same as their parent.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Set all cards to relative position so z-index can work\*/
>
> .card { position: relative; }
>
> /\*The Ace card sits on top of the pile\*/
>
> .card.ace { z-index: 2; }
>
> /\*The Five card sits at the bottom of the pile\*/
>
> .card.five { z-index: 0; }
>
> /\*The Queen card sits in between the Ace and the Five\*/
>
> .card.queen { z-index: 1; }

## Masking and clipping

> These two features allow us to hide parts of an element in order to
> show a background image or color, or to give an element a special
> shape. Both terms can be a bit confusing, so let\'s see a brief
> description of each:

-   **Clipping** is done with vectors or paths since this CSS feature
    was taken from the SVG specification. It creates a solid edge
    between the element and its background.

-   **Masking**, on the other hand, uses images/bitmaps. With images, we
    can have \"*feathered*\" or blurred edges, whereas with clipping we
    have straight edges.

> Let\'s check these properties out.
>
> []{#_bookmark252 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*

### mask {#mask-1}

> The mask CSS property is the shorthand for the mask-clip,
> mask-composite, mask- image, mask-mode, mask-origin, mask-position,
> mask-repeat, and mask-size properties. We\'ll see each of these in
> more detail later. The mask property looks like this:
>
> mask: url(../images/mask.png) 50% 50% / contain no-repeat border- box;

#### Description

> A group of all the prior properties is called a \"*mask layer*\".
>
> It\'s recommended to use the shorthand syntax over individual specific
> properties, since the shorthand resets undeclared properties to their
> initial values. This is helpful because it makes it easier to override
> values later in the cascade, thus avoiding specificity issues and
> potential use of the !important directive.
>
> Additionally, mask-clip and mask-origin use a geometry value. If we
> declare only one value, then both properties will use that value. With
> two values, mask-clip will use the first one and mask-origin will use
> the second one.
>
> As I mentioned before, CSS masks use images, which means that we can
> reference a bitmap/raster file with a transparency or a background
> gradient with the linear- gradient() CSS function. We can even create
> a mask by referencing several images in the same declaration.
>
> There are two types of mask: *alpha* masks and *luminance* masks.
> We\'ll see what each of these types of mask are later.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Mask referencing a bitmap file.
>
> We are specifying: mask-image mask-position / mask-size mask- repeat
> mask-clip
>
> \*/
>
> .element {
>
> mask: url(../images/mask.png) 50% 50% / contain no-repeat border-box;
>
> }
>
> /\*Mask using the CSS linear-gradient property\*/
>
> .element {
>
> mask: linear-gradient(black 5%, transparent);
>
> }

[]{#_bookmark253 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

> /\*Mask created by declaring multiple masks\*/
>
> .element { mask:
>
> url(../images/mask.png) 50% 50% / contain no-repeat border- box,
>
> linear-gradient(white 5%, transparent);
>
> }

### mask-clip {#mask-clip-1}

> The mask-clip CSS property determines the area of the element that
> will be affected by the mask, and it looks like this:
>
> mask-clip: padding-box;

#### Description

> This property is similar to the background-clip CSS property. Refer to
> *Chapter 4*, *CSS Properties -- Part 1*, for more information.
>
> Multiple comma-separated keyword values can be present in the same
> declaration. Each value represents its corresponding image in the
> comma-separated values of the mask-image property.
>
> It supports four keyword values: border-box, content-box, padding-box,
> and no- clip.

-   border-box: This is the default value. If the element has any
    borders, they are seen through the mask.

-   content-box: Only the parts of the element that are inside its
    *content* area are visible through the mask.

-   padding-box: If the element has any padding, it will be seen through
    the mask.

-   no-clip: The content is not *clipped*.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Padding box clipping\*/
>
> .element { mask-clip: padding-box; }
>
> /\*Multiple values\*/
>
> .element { mask-clip: padding-box, border-box; }
>
> []{#_bookmark254 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*

### mask-composite {#mask-composite-1}

> The mask-composite CSS property defines how multiple masks with
> different
>
> shapes are combined or *composited* to form a single mask, and it
> looks like this:
>
> mask-composite: intersect;

#### Description

> The mask-composite property works when mask-image is used and at least
> two mask images are declared. Multiple comma-separated keyword values
> can be present in the same declaration. Each value represents its
> corresponding image in the comma-separates values of the mask-image
> property.
>
> The mask-composite CSS property supports four keyword values: add,
> subtract, exclude, and intersect.
>
> For example, picture part of triangle over part of a circle, where the
> triangle is on top and the circle below; the different types of
> *composite* make different shapes of masks:

![](./images-ref/media/image48.png)

[]{#_bookmark255 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

-   intersect: The shape of the mask is where the triangle and the
    circle overlap, or *intersect*. The rest of the shape is discarded.

-   exclude: The part where the triangle and the circle intersect is
    discarded, and the rest of the elements is what makes the mask.

-   subtract: Since the triangle is on top, it will *trim* or *crop* the
    circle, thus leaving a **Pac-Man** shape mask.

-   add: The triangle is fused to the circle creating a single shape
    that will be used as the mask.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Intersect the masks\*/
>
> .element { mask-composite: intersect; }
>
> /\*Multiple values\*/
>
> .element { mask-composite: intersect, exclude; }

### mask-image {#mask-image-1}

> The mask-image CSS property defines the image or images to be used as
> mask layers
>
> on any given element, and it looks like this:
>
> mask-composite: intersect;

#### Description

> The mask-image property may also refer to \<mask\> elements in an SVG
> file. Multiple values are comma-separated. The images can be bitmap
> files, SVGs, and even CSS gradients that are images as well.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Mask referencing a bitmap\*/
>
> .element { mask-image: url(../images/mask.png); }
>
> /\*Mask using a CSS gradient\*/
>
> .element { mask-image: linear-gradient(black 5%, transparent); }
>
> /\*Mask referencing an SVG \<mask\>\*/

> /\*Multiple values\*/
>
> .element { mask-image: url(../images/mask.png), linear- gradient(black
> 5%, transparent); }
>
> []{#_bookmark256 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*

### mask-mode {#mask-mode-1}

> The mask-mode CSS property defines whether the mask layer is an alpha
> mask or a
>
> luminance mask. These terms are the actual keyword values, and it
> looks like this:
>
> mask-mode: alpha;

#### Description

> Multiple comma-separated keyword values can be present in the same
> declaration. Each value represents its corresponding image in the
> comma-separates values of the mask-image property.

##### Alpha masks

> Alpha masks use the *alpha channel* of the image. Whatever is
> transparent will be covered; whatever is opaque will show. Of course,
> a semi-transparent area on the image is partially covered.

##### Luminance masks

> Luminance masks uses the *luminance values* of the image. Whatever is
> *white* on the image being used as mask will show. Whatever is black
> is hidden. Gray areas partially cover the image.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Alpha mask\*/
>
> .element { mask-mode: alpha; }
>
> /\*Multiple values\*/
>
> .element { mask-mode: alpha, luminance; }

### mask-origin {#mask-origin-1}

> The mask-origin CSS property defines the location or position of the
> mask layer in
>
> relation to the element\'s box starting at the top left corner, and it
> looks like this:
>
> mask-mode: alpha;

#### Description

> The mask-origin property works in a similar way to the
> background-origin
>
> property. Refer to *Chapter 4*, *CSS Properties -- Part 1*, for more
> information.
>
> Now, this property can be used in both HTML and SVG elements. However,
> there are some keyword values that apply to one that won\'t work on
> the other.

[]{#_bookmark257 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

> Multiple comma-separated keyword values can be present in the same
> declaration. Each value represents its corresponding image in the
> comma-separates values of the mask-image property.
>
> The HTML keyword values are border-box, padding-box, margin-box, and
>
> content-box.
>
> The SVG keyword values are view-box, fill-box, and stroke-box.

-   border-box: The origin starts at the top left corner of the border
    box. It will include the border and any padding (if any is declared)
    when applying the mask, but it will not go beyond that border.

-   padding-box: The origin starts at the top-left corner of the padding
    box. It will include the padding when applying the mask, but it will
    not include any borders if any are declared.

-   margin-box: The origin starts at the top-left corner of the margin
    box. It will include the margin, the border, and the padding when
    applying the mask.

-   content-box: The origin starts at the top-left corner of the content
    box. It will include only the *content* area. No margins, padding,
    or borders are taken into consideration.

-   view-box: It uses the closest SVG viewport as a reference box.

-   fill-box: The position of the mask is relative to the *object
    bounding box*.

-   stroke-box: The position of the mask is relative to the *stroke
    bounding box*.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Content box origin; the mask will exclude borders and paddings\*/
>
> .element { mask-origin: content-box; }
>
> /\*Multiple values\*/
>
> .element { mask-origin: border-box, padding-box; }

### mask-position {#mask-position-1}

> The mask-position CSS property defines the starting position of the
> mask, and it
>
> looks like this:
>
> mask-position: right top;

#### Description

> This property works similar to the background-position property. Refer
> to *Chapter 4*, *CSS Properties -- Part 1*, for more information.
>
> []{#_bookmark258 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*
>
> Multiple comma-separated keyword values can be present in the same
> declaration. Each value represents its corresponding image in the
> comma-separates values of the mask-image property.
>
> The mask-position CSS property supports several types of values: four
> *keyword* values, top, right, bottom, and left; a *length* value, px,
> em, in, mm, cm, vw, and so on; and a *percentage* value such as 50%,
> 85%, and so on.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Keyword values\*/
>
> .element { mask-position: right top; }
>
> /\*Length and Percentage values\*/
>
> .element { mask-position: 50px 25%; }
>
> /\*Multiple values\*/
>
> .element { mask-position: right top, 50% 50%; }

### mask-repeat {#mask-repeat-1}

> The mask-repeat CSS property defines whether a mask layer is repeated
> or not, and
>
> it looks like this:
>
> mask-repeat: space;

#### Description

> This property works in a similar way to the background-repeat
> property. Refer to
>
> *Chapter 4*, *CSS Properties -- Part 1*, for more information.
>
> Multiple comma-separated keyword values can be present in the same
> declaration. Each value represents its corresponding image in the
> comma-separates values of the mask-image property.
>
> It supports six keyword values: repeat, no-repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y,
> space, and round.

-   repeat: The mask will be repeated on both the *X* and *Y* axes. This
    is the default value.

-   no-repeat: The mask is not repeated on any axis. The mask image is
    displayed only once.

-   repeat-x: The mask is repeated on the *X* axis (horizontally).

-   repeat-y: The mask is repeated on the *Y* axis (vertically).

-   space: The mask is repeated as many times as possible without being
    clipped or cut in both the *X* and *Y* axes.

[]{#_bookmark259 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

-   round: Similar to the space value, the difference is that the mask
    images are rescaled in order to fit the specified direction.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Space out the mask without clipping it\*/
>
> .element { mask-repeat: space; }
>
> /\*Repeat the mask in the X-axis (horizontally)\*/
>
> .element { mask-repeat: repeat-x; }
>
> /\*Multiple values\*/
>
> .element { mask-repeat: space, repeat-x; }

### mask-size {#mask-size-1}

> The mask-size CSS property defines the dimensions or size of a mask
> image, and it
>
> looks like this:
>
> mask-size: contain;

#### Description

> The mask-size property works similar to the background-size property.
> Refer to
>
> *Chapter 4*, *CSS Properties -- Part 1*, for more information.
>
> Multiple comma-separated keyword values can be present in the same
> declaration. Each value represents its corresponding image in the
> comma-separates values of the mask-image property.
>
> The mask-position CSS property supports several types of value: a
> *length* value, a
>
> *percentage* value, and three *keyword* values.

-   Length value: This is when we use one of the following units: px,
    em, in, mm, cm, vw, and so on.

-   Percentage value: This is when we use percentages such as 50%, 85%,
    and so on.

-   contain: This scales the image mask without distorting its aspect
    ratio to fit the maximum width or height of the element.

-   cover: This scales the image mask and distorts it if necessary in
    order to fit the maximum width or height of the element. If the
    image mask is larger on its width or height, it will get clipped.

-   auto: This scales the image mask to the actual size of the image\'s
    intrinsic proportions without distorting it.

### mask-type {#mask-type-1}

> The mask-type CSS property is specifically for SVG files. It specifies
> if an SVG
>
> \<mask\> element is an *alpha* or a *luminance* mask.
>
> For the definitions of *alpha* and *luminance* masks, refer to the

### mask-border {#mask-border-1}

> The mask-border CSS property is the shorthand for the
> mask-border-source, mask-border-mode, mask-border-slice,
> mask-border-width, mask-border- outset, and mask-border-repeat
> properties. It looks like this:
>
> mask-border: url(../images/border-image-mask.png) 15 / 15px stretch
> and so on;

#### Description

> Using the shorthand is recommended because any values that are not
> declared are set to their initial values, thus making it easier to
> override down the road, minimizing the use of the !important
> directive.

> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> mask-border: url(../images/border-image-mask.png) 15 / 15px stretch;
>
> }

### mask-border-source {#mask-border-source-1}

> The mask-border-source CSS property defines an image that is to be
> used in the
>
> border-image declaration.

[]{#_bookmark261 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

> **CSS**:

### mask-border-slice {#mask-border-slice-1}

> The mask-border-slice CSS property is used to **slice** the image into
> nine parts, and it looks like this:
>
> mask-border-slice: 40;

#### Description

> Think of this example: take a square image and trace two vertical
> lines and then two horizontal lines. We end up with nine parts, like
> **Tic-Tac-Toe**, on top of the image.
>
> This property supports one, two, three, or four keyword offset values:
> top, right, bottom, left, and fill. These values, except fill, can be
> declared using either a *number* value without a unit or a
> *percentage* value using 50%, 85%, and so on.
>
> If one value is declared, all four sides take that value. If two
> values are declared, the first value is for the top and bottom sides,
> and the second value for the left and right sides. If three values are
> declared, then the first value is for the top side, the second value
> is for the left and right sides, and the third for the bottom side. If

### mask-border-width {#mask-border-width-1}

> The mask-border-width CSS property scales the mask image slices
> created by the
>
> mask-border-slices property, and it looks like this:
>
> mask-border-width: auto;

#### Description

> This mask-border-width property supports one, two, three, or four
> keyword offset values: top, right, bottom, left, and auto. These
> values, except auto, can be declared using either a *number* value
> without a unit, or a *percentage* value such as 50%, 85%, and so on.

> four values are declared, they correspond to top, right, bottom and
> left sides.

##### auto

> *Chapter 6*
>
> It makes the mask border use the intrinsic width or height of the
> image slice. The browser is the one that decides if it needs to use
> this intrinsic width or height or not.
>
> **CSS**:

### mask-border-outset

> The mask-border-outset CSS property defines the amount the border mask
> image
>
> area extends beyond its border box, and it looks like this:
>
> mask-border-outset: 10px;

#### Description

> This property supports one, two, three, or four keyword outset values:
> top, right, bottom, and left. These values can be declared using
> either a *number* value without a unit, or a *length* value using px,
> em, in, mm, cm, vw, and so on. The *number* value without a unit is a
> multiplier of the border-width property of the element.

### mask-border-repeat {#mask-border-repeat-1}

> The mask-border-repeat CSS property defines how the image mask for all
> four sides and the center are scaled and tiled (repeated) around the
> element, and it looks like this:
>
> mask-border-repeat: repeat;

#### Description

> The mask-border-repeat property supports one or two keyword values.
> The values are: repeat, round, stretch and space.

##### repeat

> The mask border image is tiled (repeated). Under certain
> circumstances, the image mask can be clipped on the edges showing only
> part of it.

##### round

> This works in a similar way to repeat; the difference is that the
> image mask is scaled
>
> to fit exactly in the allotted distance without clipping the image
> mask.

##### stretch

> This is the default value. The image mask is stretched to completely
> fill the area.

##### space

> Similar to repeat, but the difference is that if the area isn\'t
> filled with complete
>
> image masks, it will distribute the space around the tiles.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> mask-border-repeat: repeat;

### clip-path

> The clip-path CSS property is used to partially or fully hide parts of
> an element and it looks like this:
>
> clip-path: url(..images/file.svg#clipping-path);

#### Description

> *Chapter 6*
>
> We can say that clip-path is a form of *masking*. The difference is
> that clipping uses a vector graphic to do the clipping, rather than a
> bitmap/raster image.
>
> This vector graphic can be a *basic shape* or an *SVG path*.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image50.png){width="0.3199507874015748in"
> height="0.39964129483814526in"}Note: The clip CSS property is now
> deprecated due to poor features and limitations with SVGs. The current
> and widely supported clip-path property is part of the SVG
> specification, and it\'s been adopted by the CSS masking module.
>
> The clip-path CSS property combined with the shape-outside property
> can create amazing layouts. With this combination, we can make a
> paragraph \"*curve*\" around a clipped element whose basic shape is
> also a curve or circle.
>
> This property supports four values: three *functions*: url(), a
> *shape*, a *geometry box*, and one *keyword* value none.

##### url()

> This CSS function points to an SVG clipPath element that will be used
> as the clipping path.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Clipping path referenced from an external SVG file\*/
>
> .element { clip-path: url(..images/file.svg#clipping-path); }
>
> /\*Clipping path referenced from an embedded SVG\*/
>
> .element { clip-path: url(#clipping-path); }

##### circle()

> This CSS function declares a circle as a clipping path. This function
> accepts two arguments: a *shape radius* and a *position*.

-   **Shape radius**: It defines the radius of the circle. It supports a
    *length*, a

> *percentage*, and two *keyword* values. Negative values are not
> allowed. The two keyword values are: closest-side or farthest-side.

-   closest-side: This is the default value. If this value is not
    declared, the browser will take the length from the center of the
    circle to its closest side, and create a circle based on that
    distance. With this, the circle never bleeds or overflows the
    content, it\'s always complete.

> []{#_bookmark266 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*

-   farthest-side: This value will create a circle by taking the length
    from the center to the farthest side. This means that if the element
    has a side that is longer than the other, the circle will bleed or
    overflow on the opposite sides.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Position**: It defines the location of the circle. The position
    value is preceded by the at word. If this value is not declared, the
    circle will be positioned at the center of the element. The values
    for this argument are the same as those of the background-position
    property.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Circle 150px wide and tall with location\*/
>
> .element { clip-path: circle(150px at 0 50%); }
>
> /\*Circle without location is centered on the element\*/
>
> .element { clip-path: circle(150px); }
>
> /\*Circle defaults to closest-side and is centered on the element\*/
>
> .element { clip-path: circle(); }

##### ellipse()

> This CSS function declares an ellipse as a clipping path. It takes the
> same arguments as the circle() function; the only difference is that
> it accepts two radii values, rx and ry, for the shape radius instead
> of one. rx represents the *X* axis and ry the *Y* axis.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Ellipse with location\*/
>
> .element { clip-path: ellipse(200px 100px at 0 50%); }
>
> /\*Ellipse without location is centered\*/
>
> .element { clip-path: ellipse(200px 100px); }
>
> /\*No value makes an ellipse that is as wide an tall as the element\*/
>
> .element { clip-path: ellipse(); }

##### inset()

> This CSS function defines a rectangle shape inside the element. It can
> take one, two, three, or four offset values. The syntax is the same as
> the syntax of the margin property.
>
> It supports a *length* and a *percentage* value.
>
> Additionally, the inset() function also supports a border-radius
> value, which is optional. This value must be preceded by the term
> round before any *length* or *percentages* are declared.

[]{#_bookmark267 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Inset clip path where all four offset sides have the same
> distance\*/
>
> .element { clip-path: inset(20px); }
>
> /\*Inset clip path with border-radius declared\*/
>
> .element { clip-path: inset(5% 20px 10% 40px round 20px); }

##### polygon()

> This CSS function is used to declare more various types of shapes,
> usually irregular ones that are different from a square, a circle or
> an ellipse.
>
> *Coordinate pairs* are used to declare the points of the polygon; each
> pair specifies the position of a point. The first argument represents
> the X-position and the second
>
> argument, the Y-position coordinates. The first and last coordinate
> points are closed automatically by the browser. The coordinate values
> are comma-separated and support a *length* or a *percentage* value.
>
> Now, creating polygons by hand is not only a major undertaking but it
> could be very time consuming. The best solution is to use a tool for
> the creation process:

-   Bennet Feely\'s *Clippy* (<http://bennettfeely.com/clippy/)>

-   *Clip Path Generator* (<http://cssplant.com/clip-path-generator)>

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*This polygon has 3 pairs of coordinates so it creates a
> triangle-shaped clipping path\*/
>
> .element { clip-path: polygon(0 0, 0 100%, 100% 0); }
>
> /\*Custom polygon (a star) from Bennett Feely\'s, Clippy tool\*/
>
> .element { clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 63% 38%, 100% 38%, 69% 59%,
>
> 82% 100%, 50% 75%, 18% 100%, 31% 59%, 0% 38%, 37% 38%); }

##### none

> There is no clipping path that gets created.

## Image rendering and orientation

> Making sure images display correctly is not only a designer\'s
> responsibility, we as web designers and developers also have a say in
> how images behave and display under particular circumstances.
>
> Let\'s see how to change the orientation and rendering quality of
> images with CSS.
>
> []{#_bookmark268 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*

### image-orientation {#image-orientation-1}

> The image-orientation CSS property defines the rotation that we can
> apply to an
>
> image, and it looks like this:
>
> image-orientation: flip;

#### Description

> Many images contain information about the settings used to take a
> picture, such as ISO speed, aperture, shutter speed, camera model,
> white balance, date and time, and so on. This information is called
> **EXIF Data**, and CSS uses this data for image orientation purposes.
> It also supports one or two values in a single declaration.
>
> The image-orientation property supports two keyword values and an
> *angle* value:
>
> from-image, flip, and an *angle* value.

-   from-image: The image is rotated using the EXIF Data contained in
    the image.

-   flip: The image is flipped horizontally; it\'s reflected. This value
    should go after the *angle* value.

-   Angle value: This defines the rotation applied to the image. It uses
    a number followed by the deg unit. This value should go before the
    flip keyword value.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Flip the image horizontally\*/ img { image-orientation: flip; }
>
> /\*Rotate the image 180 degrees and flip it horizontally\*/ img {
> image-orientation: 180deg flip; }
>
> /\*Follow the orientation from the EXIF information in the image\*/
> img { image-orientation: from-image; }

### image-rendering {#image-rendering-1}

> The image-rendering CSS property defines what type of algorithm the
> browser
>
> should use to render scaled images, and it looks like this:
>
> image-rendering: pixelated;

#### Description

> *Chapter 6*
>
> The image-rendering CSS property works for either downscaled or
> upscaled images. This property supports three keyword values: auto,
> crisp-edges, and pixelated.

-   auto: This is the default value. When an image is either scaled up
    or down, this property *smooths* or blurs the image in order to
    preserve the best appearance possible. However, sometimes this may
    produce undesired results, depending on the type of image.

-   crisp-edges: This property does not apply any smoothing or blurring
    to the image. It preservers its contrast, edges, and color. This
    property was exclusively created for pixel art.

-   pixelated: This property only works on images that have been scaled
    up via the **nearest neighbor** algorithm, which makes the image
    look like it was made with large pixels. This is useful when scaling
    up *checkered* patterns like a chessboard, a checkerboard, or QR
    codes.

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Good for checkered patterns or QR codes\*/ img { image-rendering:
> pixelated; }
>
> /\*Exclusively for pixel art\*/
>
> img { image-rendering: crisp-edges; }

## User interface

> The following properties are directly tied to UX Design but on the
> frontend. Addressing the following properties from the beginning of
> any build can go a long way.
>
> Let\'s check them out.

### cursor

> The cursor CSS property defines the style of the pointer, and it looks
> like this:
>
> cursor: pointer;
>
> []{#_bookmark270 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*

#### Description

> The cursor property is meant to work only in the hover state; this
> property is not meant to replace the styling of the pointer in its
> *normal* state.
>
> All operating system have many types of cursors for all types of
> behaviors, so whenever we need a certain action a cursor for it may
> already exist.
>
> We can also use custom cursors. Keep in mind the following notes:

-   It\'s recommended that the image of the cursor is 32 x 32 pixels.

-   It\'s required to declare a built-in cursor to act as a fallback in
    case the custom image(s) doesn\'t load.

-   Legacy versions of IE require an absolute path to the image of the
    custom cursor.

-   We can use .cur or .png files for custom cursors. However, legacy
    IEs only support the .cur extension.

> The cursor CSS property can accept one or multiple values in the same
> declaration.
>
> This property supports the following values: a URL, X and Y
> coordinates, and 32 keyword values.

##### A URL (or URI)

> The URL is used for custom cursors. It\'s the path to the image.
> Several URLs can be defined in the same declaration. Thus, several
> custom cursors can be used. If declaring more than one URL, the values
> are comma-separated.
>
> It\'s mandatory that after the declaration of the URL, a native
> non-URL value should be declared. This is so if everything else fails,
> the user can still use the pointer. This value is optional.

##### X and Y coordinates

> The X and Y coordinates are used to align the custom cursor with the
> right hotspot. These coordinates are just two numbers without a unit
> and separated only by a space.
>
> Negative numbers are not allowed and the values range from 0 to 32.

##### 32 keyword values

> The keyword values use the operating system or browser native cursors.
> There\'s practically a cursor for any pointer action.

*Chapter 6*

> Here\'s a list of the 32 keyword values:

-   alias

-   all-scroll

-   auto

-   cell

-   col-resize

-   context-menu

-   copy

-   crosshair

-   default

-   e-resize

-   ew-resize

-   help

-   move

-   n-resize

-   ne-resize

-   nesw-resize

-   no-drop

-   none

-   not-allowed

-   ns-resize

-   nw-resize

-   nwse-resize

-   pointer

-   progress

-   row-resize

-   s-resize

-   se-resize

-   sw-resize

-   text

-   vertical-text

-   w-resize

-   wait

> []{#_bookmark271 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*
>
> Some of the most commonly used values are default, move, pointer, and
> text:

-   default: This sets the default pointer. This is the arrow pointer we
    all know.

-   move: This sets the *move* pointer. It looks like a large plus sign
    with arrows on all four ends.

-   pointer: This sets the pointer to the \"hand\" icon.

-   text: This sets the *text* pointer. It usually looks like a serif
    capital \"I\" but taller.

> See all cursors in action here: <http://tiny.cc/cursor>
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Custom cursor with absolute path and coordinates\*/
>
> .element { cursor: url(/images/cursor.cur) 10 10, default; }
>
> /\*Multiple custom cursors with coordinates\*/
>
> .element { cursor: url(/images/cursor-1.png) 5 5, url(/images/
> cursor-2.png) 0 0, default; }
>
> /\*Assign a pointer on the \<button\> and \<select\> elements\*/
> button,
>
> select { cursor: pointer; }

### pointer-events {#pointer-events-1}

> The pointer-events CSS property controls when an element in the
> document can become a target of mouse/touch events, and it looks like
> this:
>
> pointer-events: none;

#### Description

> One particularity of pointer-events is as shown in the following
> example: say we have two containers where they considerably overlap.
> If we apply pointer-events: none; to the element on top, the
> clicking/tapping goes through that element and targets the content in
> the bottom one. Basically, we can select the content on the bottom
> element even if we\'re clicking/tapping on the element on top.
>
> This property supports ten keyword values. However, only two are
> related to HTML; all the rest are part of the SVG specification, which
> is out of the scope of this guide.
>
> Those HTML-related values are none and auto.

[]{#_bookmark272 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

##### none

> No mouse/touch events will act on the element. However, if the element
> has descendants with pointer-events set to a different value, those
> descendent elements will trigger mouse events.

##### auto

> This is the default value. This acts as if no pointer-events were
> declared.
>
> More info on MDN can be found here:
> <http://tiny.cc/mdn-pointer-events>
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Clicking/tapping on the element won\'t work\*/
>
> .element { pointer-events: none; }
>
> /\*Restore the default clicking/tapping behavior to the element\*/
>
> .element { pointer-events: auto; }

### outline {#outline-1}

> The outline CSS property creates a border around an element to provide
> a visual cue that it\'s active or has gained focus.
>
> This property is the shorthand for the outline-color, outline-width
> and outline-style properties. For convenience, it\'s recommended to
> always use this shorthand rather than separate properties when
> declaring outline.
>
> The difference between outline and border is that outline doesn\'t
> take up space; it\'s created on top of the content, so the layout is
> never affected by it.
>
> However, declaring the outline values is exactly the same as declaring
> the border
>
> values.

#### Description

> The outline CSS property supports three values represented in longhand
> properties: the *color*, the *width*, and the *style*. All three
> values are required and can appear in any order in the declaration.

-   color: This is mapped to the outline-color property. It\'s the color
    of the outline. It supports all color modes: HEX, RGB, RGBa, HSL,
    HSLs, and color name.

-   width: This is mapped to the outline-width property. It\'s the
    thickness of the outline. It supports any length value, such as px,
    em, in, mm, cm, vw, and so on. Percentage values are not valid.

> []{#_bookmark273 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*

-   style: This is mapped to the outline-style property. It\'s the type
    of line to be used. It takes the same values as border: dashed,
    dotted, double, groove, hidden, inset, none, outset, ridge, and
    solid.

> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> outline: dotted 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);
>
> }

## 3-Dimensional

> The power of CSS is mind-boggling; not only can we do amazing
> animations just with CSS, but CSS can also handle three-dimensional
> designs.
>
> Let\'s check out the properties that allows us to do so.

### perspective {#perspective}

> The perspective CSS property defines the distance between the screen
> and the user
>
> in the *Z* axis, and it looks like this:
>
> perspective: 300px;

#### Description

> Keep in mind that the perspective property is applied to the parent
> element in order to enable a 3D canvas or space in which its child
> elements will move.
>
> This property accepts a keyword value, normal, and a *length* value.

##### normal

> No perspective is defined on the parent element.

##### Length value

> This is when we use one of the following units: px, em, in, mm, cm,
> vw, and so on.
>
> The lower the value, the closer the elements will move in the *Z*
> axis. Thus, the perspective is more pronounced. With higher values,
> the perspective effect is less intense.

[]{#_bookmark274 .anchor}*Chapter 6*

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Enable perspective for child elements by applying it on the parent
> container\*/
>
> .parent-container { perspective: 300px; }
>
> /\*Child element will move in a 3D plane\*/
>
> .parent-container .element { transform: rotateX(170deg); }

### perspective-origin {#perspective-origin-1}

> The perspective-origin CSS property defines the origin of the *X* and
> *Y* axis of an element in a 3D space, and it looks like this:
>
> Perspective-origin: 24% center;

#### Description

> This is what is known as the **vanishing point** used by the
> perspective property. The perspective-origin property supports a
> combination of three types of value: a *length* value, a *percentage*
> value, and five keyword values in both *X* and *Y* axes.

##### Length value

> This is when we use one of the following units: px, em, in, mm, cm,
> vw, and so on.

##### Percentage value

> This is when we use percentages like 50%, 85%, and so on.

##### Keyword values

> The five keyword values are top, right, bottom, left, and center.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> Adding to the prior CSS from the perspective example:
>
> /\*Enable perspective for child elements by applying it on the parent
> container\*/
>
> **/\*The origin of the perspective X and Y-axis\*/**
>
> .parent-container { perspective: 300px;
>
> **perspective-origin: 24% center;**
>
> }
>
> /\*Child element will move in a 3D plane\*/
>
> .parent-container .element { transform: rotateX(170deg); }
>
> []{#_bookmark275 .anchor}*[CSS Properties -- Part 3]{.underline}*

### backface-visibility {#backface-visibility-1}

> The backface-visibility CSS property defines whether the rear face of
> an element
>
> that\'s facing the viewer is visible or not, and it looks like this:
>
> backface-visibility: hidden;

#### Description

> The backface-visibility property supports two self-explanatory keyword
> values:
>
> visible and hidden.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> And finalizing the prior example from the perspective-origin example:
>
> /\*Enable perspective for child elements by applying it on the parent
> container\*/
>
> /\*The origin of the perspective X and Y-axis\*/
>
> .parent-container { perspective: 300px;
>
> perspective-origin: 24% center;
>
> }
>
> /\*Child element will move in a 3D plane\*/
>
> **/\*The backside of the element will not be visible\*/**
>
> .parent-container .element { transform: rotateX(170deg);
> **backface-visibility: hidden;**
>
> }

## Summary

> And this is it for the CSS Properties chapters, quite a ride eh?
>
> In this final chapter we learned how to work with the Page Box\'s
> properties like bleed and marks for printing. We also learned that
> HTML lists are used for many other things like menus, navigation,
> slideshow, and so on, amongst other things like CSS counters and how
> to create custom styles for list marks.
>
> Creating the effect of depth with drop shadows is quite easy with the
> box-shadow property. Just don\'t overdo it. Then we learned about
> display and visibility, one of the most important features of CSS. In
> this section we learned how to clear floating elements as well in
> addition to applying filters to images and elements alike.

*Chapter 6*

> Masking and clipping elements isn\'t so difficult after all, we can
> use either bitmaps or vectors depending on our specific circumstances.
> This led us to understand better how to work with images and their
> orientation.
>
> Then we talked about some User Interface features like creating custom
> cursors or adapting the default cursor to change depending on its
> context.
>
> And finally we learned about the 3D properties like perspective and
> backface- visiblity that allow us to do pretty cool things with CSS
> only.

# CSS Functions

> CSS functions are used for many things in CSS. They can be used to
> create special types of processes such as creating animations or use
> custom fonts, or create visual effects like transparencies or
> transforming elements in both two-dimensional
>
> and three-dimensional planes.
>
> Let\'s see what CSS functions are all about.

## Filter {#filter-2}

> CSS filters allow us to manipulate the color of an element in
> different ways.

### brightness()

> The brightness() CSS function is used with the filter property, and it
> looks like this:
>
> filter: brightness(20%);

#### Description

> The brightness() function modifies the illumination of an image.
> Values are declared as either a *percentage* or a *number* without a
> unit, for example, 10% and 0.5%
>
> A value of 100% leaves the element unchanged; a value of 0% makes the
> element completely black. Values over 100% are allowed and create a
> more intense effect. There is no limit to the value.
>
> A value of 1 leaves the element unchanged; a value of 0 makes the
> element completely black. Values over 1 are allowed and create a more
> intense effect. There is no limit to the value. Also, negative values
> are not valid for either the percentage of the number.
>
> []{#_bookmark277 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> filter: brightness(20%);
>
> }

### contrast()

> The contrast() CSS function is used with the filter property, and it
> looks like this:
>
> filter: contrast(10);

#### Description

> The contrast() function modifies the contrast of an element. Values
> are declared as either a *percentage* or a *number* without a unit,
> for example, 10% and 0.5%.
>
> A value of 100% leaves the element unchanged; a value of 0% makes the
> element completely black. Values over 100% are allowed and create a
> more intense effect. There is no limit to the value.
>
> A value of 1 leaves the element unchanged; a value of 0 makes the
> element completely black. Values over 1 are allowed and create a more
> intense effect. There is no limit to the value. Also, negative values
> are not valid and decimal values are allowed for both.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> filter: contrast(10);
>
> }

### grayscale()

> The grayscale() CSS function is used with the filter property, and it
> looks like this:
>
> filter: grayscale(.8);

#### Description

> The grayscale() function converts an element to shades of black.
> Values are declared as either a *percentage* or a *number* without a
> unit, for example, 10% and 0.5%.

[]{#_bookmark278 .anchor}*Chapter 7*

> A value of 0% leaves the element unchanged; a value of 100% makes the
> element grayscale. Values over 100% are not allowed.
>
> A value of 0 leaves the element unchanged; a value of 1 makes the
> element grayscale. Values over 1 are not allowed. Also, negative
> values are not valid for either. Decimal values are allowed

### invert()

> The invert() CSS function is used with the filter property, and it
> looks like this:
>
> filter: invert(1);

#### Description

> The invert() function inverts the color of the element. If used in an
> image, it makes the image look like a film negative.
>
> A value of 100% completely inverts the element\'s color; a value of 0%
> leaves the element unchanged. Values over 100% are not allowed.
>
> A value of 1 completely inverts the element\'s color; a value of 0
> leaves the element unchanged. Values over 1 are not allowed. Also,
> negative values are not valid.
>
> Decimal values are allowed for both.

### hue-rotate()

> The hue-rotate() CSS function is used with the filter property, and it
> looks like this:
>
> filter: hue-rotate(80deg);

#### Description

> The hue-rotate() function applies a hue rotation to the element. It
> accepts an
>
> *angle* value.
>
> The angle value defines the degrees around the color wheel that the
> element sample
>
> will be modified to.
>
> There is no maximum value. However, if the value is larger than
> 360deg, the rotation will just go around. For example, if we declare
> 380deg, that would the same as 20deg.
>
> []{#_bookmark279 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*

### blur()

> The blur() CSS function is used with the filter property, and it looks
> like this:
>
> filter: blur(10px);

#### Description

> The blur() function gives the *smudge* effect. Values are declared as
> *length* values (px, em, in, mm, cm, vw and so on). The higher the
> value, the more intense the blur effect is, and vice versa.
>
> Percentage and negative values are not allowed, but decimal values
> are.

### saturate()

> The saturate() CSS function is used with the filter property, and it
> looks like this:
>
> filter: saturate(300%);

#### Description

> It affects the saturation levels of an element. Values are declared as
> either a
>
> *percentage* or a *number* without a unit, for example, 10% and 0.5%
>
> The default saturation value of an element is 100%, or 1 if using a
> unitless number.
>
> A value of 0% completely desaturates the element (it removes all color
> leaving the element in grayscale); a value of 100% leaves the element
> unchanged. Values over 100% are allowed creating a more intense
> effect.
>
> A value of 0 completely desaturates the element (it removes all color
> leaving the element in grayscale); a value of 1 leaves the element
> unchanged. Values over 1 are allowed creating a more intense effect.

### sepia()

> The sepia() CSS function is used with the filter property, and it
> looks like this:
>
> filter: sepia(100%);

#### Description

> The sepia() function converts an element to sepia. Think of a
> grayscale image but in shades of brown.

[]{#_bookmark280 .anchor}*Chapter 7*

> A value of 100% completely turns the element to sepia; a value of 0%
> leaves the element unchanged. Values over 100% are not allowed.
>
> A value of 1 completely turns the element to sepia; a value of 0
> leaves the element unchanged. Values over 1 are not allowed.
>
> Also, for both, negative values are not valid.

### Transforms

> CSS transforms have gained such popularity that it\'s rare not to see
> some sort of transformation in a website nowadays, for example, button
> shapes, animations, and layouts.
>
> Let\'s see the transformation CSS functions.

### matrix()

> The matrix() CSS function is used with the transform property, and it
> looks like this:
>
> matrix(0.5, 0, 0.0881635, 0.5, 0, 0);

#### Description

> The matrix() function is the shorthand for all transformation
> properties, since they can be combined here. This function is used to
> define a two-dimensional transformation matrix.
>
> This function requires a solid understanding of math, but in reality
> this function isn\'t something to be done by hand. Instead, we can use
> a tool like Eric Meyer\'s and Aaron Gustafson\'s *The Matrix
> Resolutions* (<http://tiny.cc/eric-meyer-matrix>).
>
> The explanation of the advanced mathematics of the matrix() function
> are beyond the scope of this book. However, for very detailed
> explanations you can refer to any of these two articles:

>
> []{#_bookmark289 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*

#### Description

## Colors

> *Chapter 7*
>
> Colors can make or break a design, there are many ways to go about
> creating palettes and all that good stuff.
>
> Let\'s take a look at *HSL(a)* and *RGB(a)*.

### hsl() and hsla()

> The hsl() and hsla() CSS functional notations set the color in
> HSL/HSLa formats, and they look like this:
>
> background-color: hsl(10, 20%, 30%);
>
> background-color: hsla(10, 20%, 30%, .5);

#### Description

> **HSL** stands for **Hue, Saturation, and Lightness** (or Luminance).
> The **a** stands for **Alpha**, which is the alpha channel, with which
> we declare the transparency of the color.
>
> The hsl() function supports three or four values separated by commas.
> The first value is the hue, which is the base color. This is declared
> with a unitless *number*. This number represents an angle in degrees
> (*10 = 10º*) in the color wheel from 0 to 360. So, 0 and 360 are Red,
> 90 is Yellow-Green, 180 is Cyan, and 270 is Blue-Magenta.
>
> The second value is the saturation, which is basically the amount of
> the base color. This is declared with a *percentage* value. 0% means
> there is no base color at all and it shows gray. 100% means the base
> color is full.
>
> The third value is the lightness, also known as luminance. This is
> basically the brightness of the base color. 0% means there is no
> lightness, hence it\'s black. 100% is full lightness, hence it looks
> white. 50% means the base color is full.
>
> The fourth value is the alpha channel. This is the transparency of the
> color. It\'s declared with a unitless *numeric* decimal value from 0
> to 1. Complete transparent is 0, and 1 is fully opaque.
>
> The great advantage that HSL color naming system has over RGB is that
> it is more intuitive. Once we choose a base color, we can easily
> create a palette based on that color by only changing the saturation
> and lightness values.
>
> You can see the HSL color wheel in CodePen:
> <http://tiny.cc/hsl-color-wheel>
>
> []{#_bookmark293 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*

>
> /\*HSLa\*/
>
> .element { background-color: hsla(10, 20%, 30%, .5); }

### rgb() and rgba()

> The rgb() and rgba() CSS functional notations set the color in
> RGB/RGBa formats, and they look like this:
>
> background-color: rgb(240, 100, 50);
>
> background-color: rgba(10, 20, 30, .5);

#### Description

> **RGB** stands for **Red, Green and Blue**. The *a* stands for
> **Alpha**, which is the alpha channel with which we declare the
> transparency of the color.
>
> This supports three or four unitless *numeric* values separated by
> commas, or three
>
> *percentage* values and one unitless *numeric* value. The last value
> is for the alpha channel.
>
> The *numeric* values range from 0 to 255. The *percentage* values
> range from 0% to 100%. For example, we can represent the color green
> as rgb(0, 255, 0) or rgb(0, 100%, 0).
>
> As I just mentioned, the fourth value is the alpha channel. This is
> the transparency of the color. It\'s declared with a unitless
> *numeric* decimal value from 0 to 1. Complete transparent is 0, and 1
> is fully opaque.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*RGB\*/

> .element { background-color: rgb(240, 100, 50); }
>
> /\*RGBa\*/
>
> .element { background-color: rgba(10, 20, 30, .5); }

## Gradients

> For those who didn\'t know, CSS gradients are actually images. But
> these images are created by the browser the moment it sees a gradient
> color declared. The thing with these images is that they are created
> on the fly and do not cause any HTTP requests.

[]{#_bookmark294 .anchor}*Chapter 7*

> CSS gradients are so powerful that we can not only create gradients in
> any direction and various shapes, but we can also create amazing
> patterns.
>
> With this being said, Lea Verou has an amazing library of CSS patterns
> created with gradients everyone reading this book should bookmark.
> Check it out here: <http://tiny.cc/leave-verou-css3-patterns>
>
> Let\'s see how to create gradients in CSS.

### linear-gradient()

> The linear-gradient() CSS function creates a gradient that transitions
> from one color to another in a *line*. It looks like this in its
> simplest form:
>
> background-image: linear-gradient(red, blue);

#### Description

> We can create linear gradients that obey practically any direction
> called the *gradient line*: left to right, right to left, top to
> bottom, bottom to top, diagonal, and at any degree in a 360º radius.
>
> If no direction for the gradient line is specified, the default value
> is from top
>
> to bottom.
>
> Any amount of colors can be declared in the gradient line. Technically
> speaking, there\'s no limit, but from a design standpoint we should
> always try to keep it simple. At least two color values are required.
>
> The linear-gradient() function supports all color modes: HEX, RGB,
> RGBa, HSL, HSLa, and *color name*.

##### Direction {#direction-2}

> We can also declare the direction of the gradient line via an *angle*
> value or four
>
> *keyword* values: to top, to bottom, to left, and to right.

-   to top: The gradient will start at the bottom and end at the top

-   to bottom: The gradient will start at the top and end at the bottom

-   to left: The gradient will start at the right and end at the left

-   to right: The gradient will start at the left and end at the right

> The *angle* value is defined at the beginning of the declaration and
> can range from 0 to
>
> 360\. Larger values wrap around the circumference.
>
> []{#_bookmark295 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*

##### Color stops

> We can also define where a color *stops* in the gradient. A color stop
> is a combination of a *color* value followed by a *stop position*,
> which is optional.
>
> Stop positions can be declared in any *length* value or a *percentage*
> value and go after the color value.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image52.png){width="0.31995188101487315in"
> height="0.3996522309711286in"}Percentage values are more commonly used
> due to the fact that they can scale with the element. Pixel values are
> fine too, but they just don\'t have the same versatility as relative
> units.
>
> Color stops are very flexible because they allow us to make solid
> transitions between colors. This is great for making patterns or other
> types of graphics that require solid color transitions, like country
> flags.
>
> When the *stop positions* aren\'t declared, the browser distributes
> the gradient colors evenly along the gradient line.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Basic gradient. Colors are distributed evenly along the gradient
> line\*/
>
> .element { background-image: linear-gradient(red, blue); }
>
> /\*Gradient goes from right to left and starts with color red\*/
>
> .element { background-image: linear-gradient(to left, red, blue); }
>
> /\*Gradient line is diagonal; inclined 170 degrees\*/
>
> .element { background-image: linear-gradient(170deg, red, blue); }
>
> /\*Gradient with stop positions in percentages\*/
>
> .element { background-image: linear-gradient(red 50%, blue 75%); }
>
> /\*Gradient with stop positions in pixels\*/
>
> .element { background-image: linear-gradient(red 100px, blue 150px); }
>
> /\*Colombian flag (yellow, blue and red bands) made with solid color
> transitions using stop positions\*/

### radial-gradient()

> The radial-gradient() CSS function creates a gradient that transitions
> from one color to another but in circular or elliptical form, and it
> looks like this in its simplest form:
>
> background-image: radial-gradient(orange, green);

#### Description

> *Chapter 7*
>
> There are three parts to a radial gradient: its *center*, its *ending
> shape*, and *color stops*.
>
> The *center* defines the location in the element from which the radial
> gradient will start; a radial gradient doesn\'t have to start at the
> center of an element. The *ending shape* defines if the radial
> gradient is going to be a circle or an ellipse. The ellipse shape is
> the default shape if the circle keyword isn\'t declared. The *color
> stops* are the colors that make the gradient and, if declared, any
> *stop positions* which are optional. Remember that stop positions can
> be declared in any *length* value or a *percentage* value and go after
> the color value.
>
> At least two colors are required to make a radial gradient, or *any*
> gradient for that matter.

##### Position {#position-2}

> We can define where the center of the radial gradient is located
> within the element.
>
> As I mentioned before, the default position is at the center of the
> element.
>
> To declare a specific position we use the keyword at and define the
> *X* and *Y* axes coordinates. This value should go before any color
> value is declared but after the *ending shape*.
>
> The *X* and *Y* axes coordinates can be declared in any *length*
> value, a *percentage* value or any of the keyword values, top, right,
> bottom, and left. This is pretty much the same way we declare the
> background-position on an element.
>
> The position requires an *ending shape* to be declared, either circle
> or ellipse; otherwise, the declaration is invalid.

##### Sizing

> We can also change the size of the radial gradient. The *size* of the
> gradient is declared before the *position* but it can go before or
> after the *ending shape*. It can take one or two values for *width*
> and *height*. If one value is declared it will be used for both.
>
> The size can be defined with a *length* value, a *percentage* value,
> or one of four *keyword values*: closest-corner, farthest-corner,
> closest-side, and farthest-side.

-   closest-corner: The size of the gradient depends on the corner that
    is closest to the center.

-   farthest-corner: The size of the gradient depends on the corner that
    is farthest from the center.

> []{#_bookmark297 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*

-   closest-side: The size of the gradient depends on the side that is
    closest to the center.

-   farthest-side: The size of the gradient depends on the side that is
    farthest from the center.

## Values

> The following CSS functions allow us to declare many custom values for
> various results. Let\'s check them out.

### attr()

> The attr() CSS function allows us to target the value of any HTML
> attribute and use in CSS, and it looks like this:
>
> attr(href);

#### Description

> The term **attr** is the abbreviation of the word **attribute**. This
> CSS function targets an
>
> *HTML attribute* and uses its value to accomplish different things via
> CSS.
>
> In CSS, the attr() function is most commonly used with the content
> property together with the :after CSS pseudo-element to inject content
> into the document, but in reality the attr() function can be used with
> *any* other CSS property.
>
> In HTML, it\'s very common to use the attr() CSS function to target
> the HTML5 data- or the href attributes. The attr() function can be
> used to target *any* HTML attribute.

[]{#_bookmark300 .anchor}*Chapter 7*

> In CSS3 the syntax of the attr() CSS function is a bit different. It
> accepts not only an attribute value but it also accepts two more
> arguments, a *type-or-unit* argument and an *attribute fallback*
> argument. The *type-or-unit* argument is optional. It tells the
> browser which type of attribute is in order to interpret its value.
> The *attribute fallback* argument defines a fallback value in case
> something goes wrong during the parsing of the main attribute of the
> element.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image53.png){width="0.31995188101487315in"
> height="0.3996336395450569in"}The new CSS3 syntax that includes the
> *type-or-unit* and the *attribute fallback* arguments is not stable
> and it may potentially be dropped from the spec. Do your research
> before deciding to use the new syntax.
>
> A good practice for printing web documents is to print the URL next to
> the linked element. Another common practice is to use a combination of
> the attr() CSS function with the content property and the HTML5 data-
> attribute in responsive tables to inject the content of a cell
> (usually a heading) next to their corresponding value via CSS, thus
> saving space.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Print the links from the content\*/ \@media print {
>
> main a\[href\]:after { content: attr(href);
>
> }
>
> }

### Responsive Table

> When the viewport width is 640px or less, the table will become
> responsive. This is accomplished by combining the use of the attr()
> CSS function with the content property and the HTML5 data- attribute.

######## HTML: {#html-3}

> \<table\>
>
> \<tr class=\"headings\"\>
>
> \<th\>Plan\</th\>
>
> \<th\>Price\</th\>
>
> \<th\>Duration\</th\>
>
> \</tr\>

>
> \<td data-label=\"Duration:\"\>3 months\</td\>
>
> \</tr\>
>
> \</table\>
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*40em = 640÷16\*/
>
> \@media (max-width:40em) {
>
> /\*Behave like a \"row\"\*/ td, tr {
>
> display: block;
>
> }
>
> /\*Hide the headings but not with display: none; for accessibility\*/
>
> .headings {
>
> position: absolute; top: -100%;
>
> left: -100%; overflow: hidden;
>
> }
>
> /\*Inject the content from the data-label attribute\*/
>
> **td:before** {
>
> **content: attr(data-label);** display: inline-block; width: 70px;
>
> padding-right: 5px; white-space: nowrap; text-align: right;
> font-weight: bold;
>
> }
>
> }

### calc()

> The calc() CSS function allows us to perform mathematical
> calculations, and it looks like this:
>
> width: calc(100% / 2 + 25px);
>
> Or like this:
>
> padding: calc(5 \* 2px - .25em);

#### Description

> *Chapter 7*
>
> We can perform those calculations with addition (+), subtraction (-),
> division (/), and multiplication (\*). It\'s commonly used to
> calculate relative values for width and height, but as you saw, we can
> use this function with any CSS property.
>
> A few things to consider are that a space is required before and after
> the addition (+) and subtraction (-) operators, otherwise a
> subtraction, for example, can be considered to have a negative value,
> for example, calc(2.5em -5px). This calc() function is invalid since
> the second value is considered a negative value. Space is required
> after the subtraction (-) operator. However, the division (/) and
> multiplication (\*) operators don\'t require the spaces.
>
> Now, when doing a division (/), the value on the right *must* be a
> *number* value. For a multiplication (\*) operation, at least one of
> the values *must* be *number* value as well.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\* The element\'s width is half its intrinsic width plus 25px\*/
>
> .element { width: calc(100% / 2 + 25px); }
>
> /\*The element\'s padding is 10px minus .25em of the result\*/
>
> .element { padding: calc(5 \* 2px - .25em); }

### url()

> The url() CSS function is used to point to an external resource, and
> it looks like this:
>
> background-image: url(..images/sprite.png);

#### Description

> The url() function uses the URL value to point or link to a resource.
> **URL** stands for

######## Uniform Resource Locator.

> This function is commonly used with the background or background-image
> properties, but it can be used with any of the properties that take a
> URL as a value, like \@font-face, list-style, cursor, and so on.
>
> The URL can be quoted using single (\' \') or double quotes (\" \"),
> or not quoted at all. However, there can\'t be any combinations of
> quote styles such as starting with a single quote and ending with a
> double quote.
>
> Also, double quotes inside a URL that uses single quotes and single
> quotes inside a URL that uses double quotes *must* be escaped with a
> backslash (\\). Otherwise, it will break the URL.
>
> []{#_bookmark303 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*
>
> The URL pointing to the resource can be either absolute or relative.
> If it\'s relative, it\'s relative to the location of the style sheet
> in the folder structure, not the webpage itself.
>
> The url() CSS function also supports Data URI\'s, which is basically
> the code of an image. So instead of pointing the selector to download
> an image in the /images folder, we can embed the actual image in the
> CSS.
>
> Be careful with this because although we are reducing an HTTP request
> (and that\'s a *huge* win), we might be making the CSS file larger and
> a bit harder to maintain if the image changes. There can also be
> potential performance and render-blocking issues.
>

### cubic-bezier()

> The cubic-bezier() function allows us to create custom acceleration
> curves, and it looks like this:
>
> animation-timing-function: **cubic-bezier(.42, 0, 1, 1)**;

#### Description

> *Chapter 7*
>
> The cubic-bezier() function is used with the animation-timing-function
> and the transition-timing-function CSS properties. Most use cases can
> benefit from the already defined easing functions we mentioned in
> *Chapter 4*, *CSS Properties*

-   *Part 1*, (ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, and linear); if
    you\'re feeling adventurous, cubic-bezier() is your best bet.

> Refer to the animation-timing-function CSS property in *Chapter 4*,
> *CSS Properties*

-   *Part 1*, to see what a **Bézier** curve looks like. The
    cubic-bezier() function takes four parameters in the form of:

> animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(**a, b, a, b**);
>
> Let\'s represent all five predefined easing functions with the
> cubic-bezier()
>
> function:

-   ease: animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(.25, .1, .25, 1);

-   ease-in: animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(.42, 0, 1, 1);

-   ease-out: animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, .58, 1);

-   ease-in-out: animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(.42, 0,

> .58, 1);

-   linear: animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1);

> I\'m not sure about you, but I prefer to use the predefined values.
>
> Now, we can start tweaking and testing each value to the decimal,
> save, and wait for the live refresh to do its thing. But that\'s too
> much wasted time testing if you ask me.
>
> The amazing Lea Verou created the best web app to work with Bézier
> curves: [www.](http://www.cubic-bezier.com/)
> [cubic-bezier.com](http://www.cubic-bezier.com/). This is by far the

## Miscellaneous {#miscellaneous-2}

> The following CSS functions have no specific category, so we grouped
> them here in a
>
> miscellaneous section. Let\'s see what we have.

### drop-shadow()

> The drop-shadow() CSS function works with the filter property adds a
> shadow under the element, and it looks like this:
>
> drop-shadow(5px 5px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5));

#### Description

> The drop-shadow() function works almost exactly the same way as the
> box-shadow property with two differences: the drop-shadow() function
> doesn\'t support the spread-radius or the inset values.
>
> Please refer to the box-shadow property for a detailed description of
> all the values. Additionally, some browsers actually provide hardware
> acceleration when using this function, which eventually improves
> performance. You know how it goes; anything we can do to improve
> performance is always a +1.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> filter: drop-shadow(5px 5px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5));
>
> }

### element()

> The element() CSS function allows us to use any HTML element as a
> background for another HTML element, and it looks like this:
>
> background: element(#other-element);

#### Description

> Use cases for the element() function are rare, but nonetheless it is
> available to us (granted, browser support isn\'t ideal yet).

[]{#_bookmark306 .anchor}*Chapter 7*

> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> background: element(#other-element);
>
> }

### image()

> The image() CSS function allows us to target an image file to be used
> as background,
>
> and it looks like this:
>
> image(../images/sprite.png);

#### Description

> The image() function is practically the same as the url() function and
> it\'s considered to be more flexible and ideal to declare background
> images rather than using the commonly known url() function. However,
> the image() CSS function is at risk from being dropped from the spec
> due to lack of browser support.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> background-image: image(../images/sprite.png);
>
> }

### opacity() {#opacity-3}

> The opacity() CSS function works with the filter property. It defines
> the
>
> transparency (opacity) of an element, and it looks like this:
>
> filter: opacity(.2);

#### Description

> When this function is applied to an element, the element itself and
> its children are affected. This function supports a numeric value
> ranging from 0 (zero) to 1 which is the default value. A value of 0 is
> completely transparent, as in 0% opaque, and 1 is 100% opaque, no
> transparency whatsoever. Decimal numbers are allowed but negative
> values are not.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> filter: opacity(.2);
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark307 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*

### perspective() {#perspective-1}

> The perspective() CSS function is used with the transform CSS
> property, and it looks like this:
>
> perspective(300px);

#### Description

> This value gives three-dimensional perspective to the element. The
> element in question will react in a three-dimensional plane.
>
> This function works similarly to the perspective property, and the
> difference is that the perspective() function is used to give
> perspective to a single element. Hence, it\'s applied to the *element
> itself*. The perspective property is good for giving perspective to
> several elements at once, hence it is applied to the parent element
> instead.
>
> For example, if we apply the perspective() function to every element
> on a list, each element will have its own vanishing point. But if we
> apply the perspective property to the parent container of that list,
> all elements will share the same vanishing point.
>
> The perspective() function on its own doesn\'t do much, so in order to
> see it in action we must combine it with any of the other transform
> functions like rotate(), rotateX(), or rotateY().
>
> It accepts a *numeric* value with a *length* unit. Negative values are
> not allowed. The
>
> value defines the distance of the *Z* axes from the user.
>
> The higher the value, the less intense the perspective. This is
> because the element is farther away from us. However, the lower the
> value, the more pronounced the perspective looks. This is because the
> element is closer to us.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> transform: perspective(300px) rotateY(45deg);
>
> }

### rect()

> The rect() CSS function is used to create a rectangle-shaped clipping
> mask with the
>
> clip property, and it looks like this:
>
> clip: rect(0, 100px, 200px, 0);

[]{#_bookmark308 .anchor}*Chapter 7*

> ![](./images-ref/media/image54.png){width="0.3199496937882765in"
> height="0.3996576990376203in"}The clip CSS property is now deprecated
> due to poor features and limitations with SVGs. The current and widely
> supported clip-path property is part of the SVG specification and it
> has been adopted by the CSS Masking module.

#### Description

> This function *only* works with the clip property, and as I mentioned,
> this property is now deprecated. Also, this CSS function *does not*
> work with the more modern clip-path CSS property, so the
> recommendation is to use the inset() CSS function instead.
>
> Refer to the inset() CSS function in *Chapter 6*, *CSS Properties --
> Part 3*.

## At-rules

> CSS *at-rules* start with the @ character and are followed by a
> keyword or identifier.
>
> They always have to end with a semicolon (;) character.
>
> Some of the most popular at-rules are \@font-face, which is used to
> declare custom fonts; \@import that is used to import external CSS
> files (not recommended by the way for performance reasons), and it is
> also used in some CSS preprocessors to bring external partial files
> that will eventually get compiled into a single CSS file (recommended
> method); \@media is used to declare media queries in our responsive
> projects or print style sheets and so on; \@keyframes is used to
> create animations and so on.
>
> At-rules, let\'s see where they\'re *at*.

### \@charset

> The \@charset() at-rule defines the character encoding to be used by a
> style sheet, and it looks like this:
>
> \@charset \"UTF-8\";

#### Description

> We rarely need to define the character encoding in a style sheet as
> long as it\'s defined in the HTML. When the browser detects the
> character encoding in the HTML, it implies that it\'s the same
> character encoding for the CSS file(s).
>
> []{#_bookmark309 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*
>
> If you like to declare the character encoding in your CSS files,
> that\'s fine too. If you plan to use this in a style sheet, it should
> be the first thing at the top of the file. It cannot have a space
> character before the @ symbol, or a blank line above it. The
> *character encoding name* should always be inside quotes, either
> single (\' \') or double quotes (\" \").
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Correct character encoding directive\*/ \@charset \"UTF-8\";
>
> /\*Character encoding of the CSS is set to Latin-9 (Western European
> languages, with Euro sign)\*/
>
> \@charset \'iso-8859-15\';
>
> /\*This is invalid, there is a space before the @ symbol\*/ \@charset
> \"UTF-8\";
>
> /\*This is invalid, character encoding name should be inside single
> \[\'\'\] or double quotes \[\"\"\]\*/
>
> \@charset UTF-8;

### \@document()

> The \@document() at-rule allows to define styles that only apply to a
> certain pages of a site, and it looks like this in one of its forms:
>
> \@document
> [url(\'http://website.com/page.html\')](http://website.com/page.html%27))
> { \... }

#### Description

> There are four CSS functions that are exclusive to the \@document()
> at-rule: url(), url-prefix(), domain(), and regexp(\" \"). Multiple
> functions can be defined in a single declaration.
>
> The values inside the functions can either be declared without
> quotation marks, or use single (\' \') or double quotes (\" \"). Only
> the regexp(\"\") function requires the use of double quotes (\" \").

-   url(): This restricts the styles to a document that matches the URL

-   url-prefix(): This restricts the styles to a document that start
    with the specified URL

-   domain(): This restricts the styles to a document\'s specific domain

-   regexp(\"\"): This restricts the styles to a document that match the
    regular expression

[]{#_bookmark310 .anchor}*Chapter 7*

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*url() function\*/
>
> \@document
> [url(\'http://website.com/page.html\')](http://website.com/page.html%27))
> { \... }
>
> /\*url-prefix() function\*/
>
> \@document
> [url-prefix(\"http://website.com/about/\")](http://website.com/about/)
> { \... }
>
> /\*domain() function\*/
>
> \@document domain(website.com) { \... }
>
> /\*regexp() function\*/ \@document regexp(\"https:.\*\")
>
> /\*Multiple functions in a single declaration\*/ \@document
> [url(\'http://website.com/page.html\')](http://website.com/page.html%27))
> { \... },
>
> [url-prefix(\"http://website.com/about/\")](http://website.com/about/)
> { \... }, domain(website.com) { \... },
>
> regexp(\"https:.\*\") { \... }

### \@font-face

> The \@font-face() at-rule is used to define custom fonts to use on a
> document, and
>
> it looks like this in its simplest form:
>
> \@font-face {
>
> font-family: Franchise;
>
> src: url(\"../fonts/franchise.woff\") format(\"woff\");
>
> }

#### Description

> The \@font-face() at-rule has been around for actually more years than
> many believe, so our buddy IE6 supports this function. With the
> \@font-face() at-rule, we can target custom font files to use on a
> website/webapp and extend the design and branding possibilities way
> beyond system fonts.
>
> One peculiarity of custom fonts is that different versions of each
> browser support one format but not another or even has its own
> proprietary font format.
>
> Paul Irish\'s article *Bulletproof \@font-face Syntax*, where the

> The five font formats we need to account for are: WOFF/WOFF2, EOT,
> TTF, OTF,
>
> and SVG.
>
> []{#_bookmark311 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*

##### WOFF/WOFF2

> **WOFF** stands for **Web Open Font Format** and was created by
> Mozilla. The WOFF format is a *wrapper* for OTF/TTF font formats and
> it provides better font data compression than any other format, thus
> making the file(s) smaller.
>
> **WOFF2** is basically WOFF on steroids. It provides even more
> compression, about 30 percent in average and in some cases up to 50
> percent more.
>
> All modern browsers support these two formats.

##### EOT

> **EOT** stands for **Embedded Open Type** and was created by
> Microsoft. Only old versions of IE (IE6 to IE8) require the use of
> this font format. No other browsers support this format, so if we
> don\'t need to support legacy browsers, we do not need to declare a
> link to this font format in the \@font-face() at-rule declaration.

##### OTF and TTF

> **OTF** and **TTF** stand for **OpenType Font** and **TrueType Font**.
> These font formats are cross-platform compatible and include advanced
> layout features and information for expert typographic control. OTF is
> a newer format and has a few more features than TTF, such as small
> caps, ligatures, fractions, and so on.

##### SVG {#svg-2}

> **SVG** stands for **Scalable Vector Graphic**. An SVG *font file*
> doesn\'t really have a font; it has vector representations of the
> font. This type of font file is used when old iOS
>
> devices need to be supported. However, if this type of font is not
> declared, the old iOS
>
> device will simply use a system font instead, which if you ask me,
> I\'m totally fine with.
>
> The values inside the \@font-face brackets are called the **font
> descriptors**. In it, we can declare several values: font-family, src,
> font-variant, font-stretch, font- style, font-weight, and
> unicode-range.

##### font-family {#font-family-2}

> This is a required value. It defines the name of the font to be used
> in the style sheet.

##### src {#src-2}

> This is a required value. It defines the location or URL of the font
> file(s). Multiple URLs can be defined in the same src declaration
> block to account for the different types of fonts that each browser
> supports. However, legacy IEs choke when it finds multiple URLs in the
> same src declaration block, so an independent src declaration block
> needs to be declared if support for legacy IEs is required.

[]{#_bookmark312 .anchor}*Chapter 7*

> In addition to targeting external files with URLs, we can also target
> locally installed files with the local() function.

##### font-variant {#font-variant-2}

> The font-variant CSS property turns the targeted text into small caps.
> In CSS3, it\'s considered a shorthand and has been extended with new
> values, which developers rarely use. Refer to *Chapter 5*, *CSS
> Properties -- Part 2*, for more information.

##### font-stretch {#font-stretch-2}

> The font-stretch CSS property allows us to select a *condensed*,
> *normal*, or *expanded* face from the font family in question. Refer
> to *Chapter 5*, *CSS Properties -- Part 2*, for more information.

##### font-weight {#font-weight-2}

> The font-weight CSS property defines the thickness (weight) of the
> font. Refer to
>
> *Chapter 5*, *CSS Properties -- Part 2*, for more information.

##### unicode-range

> The unicode-range CSS property descriptor defines a specific range of
> characters or glyphs that should be downloaded from a font declared in
> a \@font-face declaration. This is helpful, for example, when working
> on a site with different languages. By declaring unicode-range, the
> browser only downloads the specific characters of that language for
> that page, thus saving bandwidth and optimizing performance.
>
> This property is rarely used.

#### Google fonts

> We can\'t talk about \@font-face without talking about **Google
> Fonts**. Google Fonts is a free web font service that allows us to
> practically skip all the manual work
>
> of creating \@font-face declaration block in our CSS files by giving
> us an HTML
>
> \<link\> that points to the font(s) we selected.

### \@import

> The \@import() at-rule is used to import a style sheet into another,
> and it looks like this:
>
> \@import \"other-style-sheet.css\";

#### Description

> *Chapter 7*
>
> The previous example targets another style sheet with a string value.
> But style sheets can also be imported using the url() function.
>
> The \@import rules should always precede any other rules except the
> \@charset rule, otherwise, it will be ignored by the browser.
>
> One thing to take into consideration is cascading. Imported style
> sheets cascade in the order they are imported. There is also a way to
> specify the media a specific imported style sheet is for via media
> queries. If more than one media query is declared, it needs to be
> separated by commas.

### \@keyframes

> The \@keyframes() at-rule is used to list CSS properties to be
> animated, and it looks like this:
>
> \@keyframes animationName { from {
>
> /\*Animation properties START here\*/
>
> }
>
> to {
>
> []{#_bookmark315 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*
>
> /\*Animation properties END here\*/
>
> }
>
> }

#### Description

> The animation created with the \@keyframes at-rule only runs for one
> cycle. If we want the animation to play over and over, ease-in,
> ease-out, or show other behavior, we need to declare those properties
> in the element itself, outside the \@keyframes at-rule.
>
> Please refer to the Animation section in *Chapter 4*, *CSS Properties
> -- Part 1*, for detailed explanations of those CSS properties.
>
> The animation\'s name (also called an **identifier**) always comes
> after the \@keyframes keyword separated by a space. This animation
> name will later be referenced with the animation-name or animation
> shorthand CSS properties.
>
> The beginning and end of an animation can be declared with the two
> *selector keywords* from and to, or with two *keyframe selectors* 0%
> and 100%. Negative values are not allowed.
>
> Obviously, we can declare intermediate waypoints but we can only do
> this using *keyframe selectors*. There is no limit to the amount of
> properties that can be declared in the \@keyframes at-rule. However,
> some browsers animate properties that the spec says can\'t be
> animated, while others follow the spec correctly. Granted, the spec is
> unclear about some of the definitions, so make sure to run proper
> tests.
>
> Now the difference between using \@keyframes at-rule and the
> transition property is that with the \@keyframes at-rule we have the
> power of defining what happens in the middle waypoints rather than
> letting the browser figure it out for us.
>
> Basically, if we have a simple animation, we can just use the
> transition property. If we have somewhat more complex and elaborate
> animations, use \@keyframes.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> \@keyframes diamond { from {
>
> top: 0;
>
> left: 0;
>
> }
>
> 25% {
>
> top: 200px; left: -200px;
>
> }
>
> 50% {

### \@media {#media-2}

> The \@media() at-rule allows us to define a set of CSS styles that
> apply to a certain
>
> media type, and it looks like this:
>
> \@media (min-width: 40em) { \... }
>
> You can use the preceding code or the following code as well:
>
> \@media print { \... }

#### Description

> This piece of CSS allows us to declare any set of styles to a specific
> media type.
>
> The two types of directives that come after the \@media() at-rule, for
> example, print and screen and even (min-width: 40em) or (max-width:
> 40em), and they are called **media queries**.
>
> The keywords (print and screen) are called **media types**. And the
> ones that test
>
> specific features of a **User Agent** (**UA**) or display are called
> **media features**.
>
> []{#_bookmark317 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*

##### Media types

> Media types are case-sensitive. There are 10 media types that we can
> use with the
>
> \@media() at-rule:

-   all: This is meant to work on all devices

-   braille: This is meant to work with braille tactile-feedback devices

-   embossed: This is meant to work on braille printers

-   handheld: This is meant to work with handled \"mobile\" devices

-   print: This is meant to work for printing documents

-   projection: This is meant to work with projectors

-   screen: This is meant to work with computer screens of all sizes

-   speech: This is meant to work with speech synthesizers

-   tty: This is meant to work with teletypes

-   tv: This is meant to work with televisions

> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Viewport width media query\*/ \@media (min-width: 40em) {
>
> header { background: red; }
>
> }
>
> /\*Print media query\*/ \@media print {
>
> \*, \*:before, \*:after { background-image: none; }
>
> }

### \@namespace

> The \@namespace() at-rule is used to define the XML namespaces in a
> style sheet, and
>
> it looks like this:
>
> \@namespace
> [url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);](http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml)%3B)
>
> You can use the preceding code or the following code as well:
>
> \@namespace svg
> [url(http://www.w3.org/2000/svg);](http://www.w3.org/2000/svg)%3B)

#### Description

> *Chapter 7*
>
> We use the \@namespace() at-rule in a CSS document when we need to use
> selectors that apply or target certain elements in a specific
> namespace. For example, we can have an embedded SVG file in our HTML
> document. The thing is that SVGs share common elements with HTML and
> XML, such as the \<a\> element. So instead of creating a separate
> style sheet to target the SVG elements, we can declare an SVG
> namespace with the \@namespace() at-rule to target the \<a\> elements
> within the same HTML document, thus we only have to work in one style
> sheet rather than two (or more).
>
> Now, the \@namespace() at-rule is mostly used for legacy XHTML
> documents where it\'s necessary to declare a namespace in the \<html\>
> element:
>
> \<html
> [**xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"**](http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml)
> xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\"\>
>
> With the xmlns directive in place, we can now declare the namespaces
> in our CSS. Finally, we can then target the \<a\> elements in the SVG
> block without affecting the HTML \<a\> elements.
>
> The URLs are merely to make the markup more readable and easier to
> understand when someone is reading through it.

### \@page

> The \@page() at-rule is used to modify certain properties of a page to
> get it ready for printing, and it looks like this:
>
> \@page { margin: 2cm;
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark319 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*

#### Description

> When using the \@page() at-rule, only a few properties of the page can
> be changed: margins, widows, orphans, and *page breaks*. Declaring any
> other types of properties will be ignored.
>
> We can also declare if we want to target *only the first page*, *all
> the left pages only*, or *all the right pages only* with the :first,
> :left and :right pseudo-classes. The \@page() at-rule is most commonly
> used to change the margins.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Affects all pages\*/ \@page {
>
> margin: 2cm;
>
> }
>
> /\*Affects all left pages only\*/ \@page :left {
>
> margin: .8in; orphans: 3;
>
> }
>
> /\*Affects all right pages only\*/ \@page :right {
>
> margin: 15mm;
>
> }

### \@supports

> The \@supports() at-rule is used to detect a *feature* on a browser,
> and it looks like this:
>
> \@supports (display: flex) { \... }

#### Description

> *Feature detection* is something that\'s usually done with polyfills
> like **Modernizr**. With the \@supports() at-rule, we can accomplish
> similar results via CSS only.
>
> In order for this function to work properly, we need to specify a
> *property* and a *value*. There are three keyword operators that we
> can use with the \@supports() at-rule: not, and and or.

##### The not operator

> Just like we can check for features that the browser supports, we can
> also check for features that the browser *does not* support using the
> not operator.

[]{#_bookmark320 .anchor}*Chapter 7*

##### The and operator

> The and operator allows us to check for multiple CSS properties in the
> same declaration.

##### The or operator

> A good example of this operator is when we need to check for a
> vendor-prefixed CSS property in case we need to support legacy
> browsers. When using this operator, if one of the expressions is true,
> it will make all other expressions valid as well.
>
> Additionally, we can also combine operators when necessary.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Detect a feature that is supported\*/ \@supports (transform:
> translateX(-50%)) {
>
> .element {
>
> transform: translateY(-50%)
>
> }
>
> }
>
> /\*Detect a feature that is NOT supported\*/ \@supports not
> (transform: translateX(-50%)) {
>
> .element {
>
> margin-left: 120px;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> /\*Detect multiple features\*/
>
> \@supports (transform: translateX(-50%)) and (display: flex) {
>
> .element {
>
> transform: translateY(-50%); justify-content: space-between;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> /\*Detect at least one feature\*/

## Global CSS keyword values

> The following list of keyword values is ubiquitous to web designers
> and developers,
>
> but have you ever wondered what exactly they mean and do?

#### auto

> The auto CSS keyword value tells the browser to automatically compute
> the CSS property\'s value, and it looks like this:
>
> margin: **auto**;
>
> The term **auto** is short for **automatic**. It\'s not the same as
> saying 100% because 100%
>
> is an actual defined value; auto is calculated by the browser.
>
> One of the most common locations to see the keyword auto applied is
> when centering an element horizontally with the margin CSS property.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { margin: **auto**;
>
> }
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image56.png){width="0.31995188101487315in"
> height="0.3996402012248469in"}I\'ve seen most people use margin: 0
> auto; to center an element. This is fine, but the value zero (0) can
> be omitted. margin: auto; is enough and yields the same result.

#### inherit

> The inherit CSS keyword value makes an element derive/inherit the
> values of its parent container.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*All \<h1\>\'s are red\*/ h1 { color: red; }
>
> /\*All text in .element is blue\*/
>
> .element { color: blue; }
>
> /\*Make all \<h1\>\'s inside .element blue\*/
>
> .element h1 { color: inherit; }

#### initial

> *Chapter 7*
>
> The initial CSS keyword value sets the CSS property to its default
> value as per the CSS spec.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*All \<h1\>\'s are red\*/ h1 { color: red; }
>
> /\*Set the color of all \<h1\>\'s inside .element to the default
> (black)\*/
>
> .element h1 { color: initial; }

#### none

> The none CSS keyword value defines the lack of a specific styling.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element { border: **none**;
>
> }

#### normal

> The normal CSS keyword value defines a *standard* value.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> .element {
>
> font-weight: **normal**;
>
> }

#### unset

> The unset CSS keyword is the combination of the inherit and initial
> keywords, and it looks like this:
>
> color: **unset**;
>
> By combining the inherit and initial keywords, the unset CSS keyword
> value resets the value of a property.
>
> []{#_bookmark323 .anchor}*[CSS Functions]{.underline}*
>
> If an element is inheriting values from its parent container and the
> unset keyword is declared, then the property\'s value is reset to the
> parent container\'s value (since it\'s inheriting). But if an element
> has no parent container and the unset keyword is declared, then its
> property\'s value is reset to the default value as per the spec (since
> it\'s not inheriting).
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*All \<h1\>\'s are set to the default color per the spec\*/ h1 {
> color: unset; }
>
> /\*All \<h1\>\'s are set to the default color of the parent\*/
>
> .element { color: green; }
>
> .element h1 { color: unset; }

#### revert

> The revert CSS keyword value is like an *undo* in CSS as it returns
> the cascade to a previous state and resets the property to the default
> value defined by the *user agent*. It looks like this:
>
> display: **revert**;
>
> This is different from the initial CSS keyword because revert rolls
> back the cascade and resets the value as per the user agent\'s *style
> sheet* value. With initial the value is reset to its default value as
> per the specification.
>
> For example, the spec says that the default value of display is
> inline. However, most UAs assign a default value of display: block; to
> \<div\>, or display: table; to \<table\>.
>
> **CSS**:
>
> /\*Default value per the spec\*/ display: inline;
>
> /\*Default value per the UA style sheet\*/ div { display: block; }
>
> /\*Style defined by the developer/designer\*/
>
> .element { display: inline-block; }
>
> /\*Style sheet is rolled back and DIV behaves as display: block;\*/
> div.element { display: revert; }

## Summary {#summary-3}

> This conclude the chapters about CSS, pretty interesting stuff eh?
>
> We learned about CSS Filters and how we can modify elements\' colors
> without having to rely on image editing tools. This also applies to
> CSS Transforms because we can modify the shape and orientation of
> elements\', at least to some extent, quite easily with CSS only.
>
> At the same time we learned about the different ways we can create
> colors in CSS, and that HSL mode is more intuitive and versatile than
> any other color mode.
>
> Calculating and declaring different values with the attr() or calc()
> functions opens new possibilities in our CSS toolbox, for example, how
> to make responsive tables.
>
> We now know that to improve performance with drop shadows we can use
> the drop-shadow() function; or to modify the transparency of an
> element we can use the opacity() function; or the perspective of an
> element with the perspective() function.
>
> At-rules now make more sense I\'m sure. Additionally, we addressed the
> different font formats and learned that if we don\'t need to support
> legacy IEs we can just use WOFF and WOFF2.
>
> And finally, we got clarification on the all the global CSS keyword
> values like auto or inherit that we use all the time and never really
> question what they are and how they work.

# JavaScript Implementations,

> Syntax Basics, and Variable Types
>
> JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to produce
> dynamic and user-interactive webpages. A huge number of websites and
> all the latest Internet browsers (clients) use and support JavaScript.
> It is a part of the stack of technologies that every web developer
> must learn; these include HTML (the content), CSS (the presentation of
> content), and JS (behavior of the content when a user interacts with
> the webpage).
>
> Previously, the use of JavaScript was just limited to input
> validations. For example, it can produce an error message if the user
> enters invalid information or tries to submit a form with missing
> information. Now, JS is acknowledged as a fully-fledged programming
> language that is capable of manipulating with complex calculations and
> deals with all aspects of a client window. JS enhances the webpage by
> making
>
> it more interactive. For instance, a page with scattered thumbnails
> can be converted into a pretty stylish image gallery, content of the
> website can be loaded without forcing the client to reload it over and
> over, different sorts of error handling can
>
> be done in a nice way, user polls can be created and their results can
> be viewed on a website, and playing with HTML elements on the go and
> much more is made possible by the power of JavaScript.
>
> JavaScript is quick---real quick. It responds instantly to user
> actions, such as clicking, double-clicking, resizing, dragging,
> scrolling, and so on. JavaScript has a syntax that is similar to that
> of the Java language. The name *JavaScript* causes confusion for many
> people. Only the syntax of JS resembles the syntax of the Java

> The following are some of the key differences between Java
> (programming language) and JS (scripting language):

-   JavaScript is embedded into HTML and runs in a browser, while Java
    requires a **Java Virtual Machine** (**JVM**) for its execution;
    however, Java applets can run in browsers.

-   JavaScript is known as a client-side language as it runs in the
    browser on the client end, but now, Node.js is the gateway of JS to
    the server end. On the other hand, Java runs on the web server, for
    example, **Apache Tomcat**.

-   JavaScript is usually interpreted by the client, while Java is
    compiled and then executed by a JVM.

-   JavaScript was created by **Netscape** (now Mozilla) while Java was
    developed by **Sun Microsystems** (now Oracle).

## History of JavaScript

> Brendan Eich of Netscape (now Mozilla) developed JavaScript in 1995.
> Originally, it was named as **Mocha**, later its name was changed to
> **Livescript**, and finally
>
> it was renamed to JavaScript. After its launch, Microsoft introduced
> **Jscript**--- their own version of JavaScript that was included in
> Internet Explorer. Netscape submitted JavaScript to **European
> Computer Manufacturers Association**(**ECMA**) for standardization and
> specification. The standardized version was named **ECMAScript**.
> ECMAScript is a trademarked scripting language specification
> standardized by ECMA International.
>
> The ECMAScript V5 introduced a new mode called the **strict mode**;
> this brought forward better and thorough error checking to avoid
> constructs that cause errors. Many ambiguities from the third version
> were removed and real-world implementations were added.
>
> The ECMAScriptV6 added plenty of new syntax for writing complex
> programs. It introduced classes and modules extending the semantics
> from V5. Iterators were also added in this version along with many
> Python-styled semantics, including proxies, arrow functions,
> generators and generator expressions, maps, sets, and so on.

### Evolution of JavaScript

> *Chapter 8*
>
> After the standardization of JavaScript as ECMAScript, the next step
> was to have complete control over **Document Object Model** (**DOM**).
>
> The HTML is parsed into DOM by the web browser\'s DOM API. DOM is the
> client understanding of the webpage. All the elements/nodes are
> converted into a tree-like structure known as **DOM Tree**. The
> members of this tree can be manipulated on the fly using different
> methods such as getElementById()and getElementsByName(). The HTML
> source we see in developer tools, such as **Inspect Element**, **Fire
> Bug**, and so on are DOM View. These development tools also help a lot
> to modify our DOM instantly.
>
> Later, **Asynchronous JavaScript and XML** (**AJAX**) was introduced
> to make asynchronous applications. The data was sent to and received
> from the web server without reloading or refreshing the whole DOM Tree
> (asynchronously).
>
> As JavaScript advanced, different JS libraries were developed to ease
> DOM manipulation. Some of the popular libraries are jQuery, Prototype,
> and Mootools. The primary feature of these libraries is to handle DOM
> manipulations, animations, and AJAX. The most famous and widely used
> JS library is jQuery. Furthermore, a server-side version of JavaScript
> was developed and named **Node.js**.
>
> In this book, you will learn about JavaScript, its history, and its
> evolution. You will learn about its implementations and syntax.
> Function references and complete examples for how to use it in
> different cases are also provided.

## JavaScript implementations

> As JavaScript and ECMA Script are used in similar context, JavaScript
> has much more to offer than ECMAScript. It is implemented in the
> following three parts:

-   Core JavaScript (ECMAScript)

-   Document Object Model (DOM)

-   Browser Object Model (BOM)

> []{#_bookmark328 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*

### Core JavaScript (ECMAScript)

> JavaScript supports mobile devices as well as desktop computers; this
> feature makes it a cross-platform scripting language. However, it is
> not much useful if used alone, which is why it is used along with
> server-side languages to make powerful and interactive applications.
> It can be easily integrated within a web browser environment, enabling
> users to have complete control over the browser\'s objects and events.
>
> The core capabilities of JavaScript are also called ECMAScript.
> ECMAScript is not actually browser-dependent or environment-dependent.
> It is a set of core language elements that are used in different
> environments such as **ScriptEase** and **Flash Action Script**.
> Hence, we can say that ECMA Script contains definitions for the
> following:

-   Language syntax

-   Keywords/reserved words

-   Data types

-   Statements

-   Operators

-   Control structures

-   Objects (for example, array, date, math and so on)

> Therefore, ECMAScript defines all of the functions, methods,
> properties, and objects of a scripting language. Other scripting
> languages such as JavaScript are implementations of ECMAScript.
>
> ECMAScript is implemented differently in various browsers, after which
> DOM and BOM are included.

### Document object model (DOM)

> DOM is an **Application Programming Interface**(**API**) for HTML and
> XML documents. It is a logical structure of the web document. It is a
> hierarchical tree view of the nodes that are present in the document.
> The browser translates the document into DOM and only understands it.
> DOM enables developers to take control over the nodes and to make
> changes to the document on the fly.

[]{#_bookmark329 .anchor}*Chapter 8*

> For instance, this is a simple webpage:
>
> \<html\>
>
> \<head\>
>
> \<title\>My Web Document\</title\>
>
> \</head\>
>
> \<body\>
>
> \<p\>Javascript Reference!\<p\>
>
> \</body\>
>
> \</html\>

### Browser object model (BOM)

> While DOM deals with the document, **Browser Object Model** (**BOM**)
> deals with the browser window. BOM enables programmers to perform
> several actions on the browser window, which is not directly related
> to and has no impact on the HTML document itself. BOM also deals with
> the browser objects, such as history, screen, navigator, and location.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image57.png){width="0.41783792650918633in"
> height="0.3365824584426947in"} BOM is implemented differently in
> different clients.

### Client-side JavaScript

> JavaScript is primarily known as a client-side scripting language. Any
> language that is used to write programs or scripts that are executed
> in a client (any web browser such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Google
> Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and so on) is called a **client-side
> scripting language**. These scripts make your HTML look interactive
> and dynamic. JavaScript enables user to interact with the web page\'s
> content and the client window itself.

#### Adding JavaScript into a web page

> Mostly, JavaScript code is embedded into the HTML within the
> \<script\> tags and can be viewed by viewing the source of the page. A
> good practice to embed JavaScript into your page is to place all the
> scripts in a separate file (a JavaScript file having the .js file
> extension). Then, this file can be included on the page. When the page
> is interpreted, it will be treated the same as if it was embedded on
> the same page.
>
> []{#_bookmark330 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image58.png){width="0.31995188101487315in"
> height="0.39964129483814526in"}The JavaScript files must be of a .js
> extension.
>
> Since, the client is expecting HTML all the time, anything else such
> as styles or
>
> scripts have to be enclosed in their specific tags; for example:
>
> \<style\>
>
> /\* all css code \*/
>
> \</style\>
>
> \<script\>
>
> //all scripts
>
> \</script\>
>
> The JavaScript interpreter is evoked as soon as the browser\'s
> rendering engine discovers any \<script\> tag.
>
> Most of the time, JavaScript lies within the \<head\> tags of the web
> document:
>
> \<html\>
>
> \<head\>
>
> \<title\>My First JavaScript Example\</title\>
>
> \<script type=\"text/javascript\"\> alert(\"Hello earthlings!\");
>
> \</script\>
>
> \</head\>
>
> \<body\>
>
> \</body\>
>
> \</html\>
>
> The type attribute specifies that the code enclosed within these
> \<script\> tags is plain code written in JavaScript. It is not
> compulsory to mention the type attribute. The preceding code can be
> written without it as well and will work exactly the same.
>
> Although \<script\>tags can be placed anywhere within an HTML
> document, another good practice is to place it at the end of the
> document before closing the
>
> \</body\> tag so that all the pages are loaded before any script
> executes.

### Loading external JavaScript files

> *Chapter 8*
>
> Just like external CSS files are included into the web page,
> JavaScript can also be included into the webpage from external
> JavaScript files. Let\'s take a look at the following HTML code:
>
> \<html\>
>
> \<head\>
>
> \<title\> My First JavaScript Example \</title\>
>
> \<script src=\"external_javascript_Planets.js\"\>\</script\>
>
> \</head\>
>
> \<body\>
>
> \</body\>
>
> \</html\>
>
> The src attribute is very similar to that used in the image \<img\>
> tags. It just mentions the reference path to the external JavaScript
> files, which are later included into the page. Do not add any other
> JavaScript code into the \<script\> tags, which import external JS
> files. If needed, place another \<script\> tag.
>
> Multiple external JS files can also be included, as follows:
>
> \<html\>
>
> \<head\>
>
> \<title\> My First JavaScript Example \</title\>
>
> \<script src=\"external_javascript_Moon.js\"\>\</script\>
>
> \<script src=\"external_javascript_Sun.js\"\>\</script\>
>
> \<script src=\"external_javascript)Stars.js\"\>\</script\>
>
> \</head\>
>
> \<body\>
>
> \</body\>
>
> \</html\>
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image59.png){width="0.31994641294838144in"
> height="0.39964129483814526in"}In cases where external JavaScript
> libraries, such as jQuery and MooTools
>
> are used, the order in which the files are included has to be taken
> care of.

#### Writing our first program in JavaScript

> Don\'t worry; it is not at all an alien language. It is a high-level
> language and can be understood very easily as its statements,
> keywords, and other syntax is based on basic English. The simplest way
> to learn any programming language is to jump into it and play with its
> code. To get your feet wet in JavaScript, we will write a very basic
> JavaScript program.

##### Prerequisites

> The following are the prerequisites that are required to write our
> first JavaScript
>
> program:

-   A web browser

-   A text/code editor

-   A web document

##### How to do it

1.  Create a index.html file in any code editor you are comfortable
    with. Copy

and paste the following code into your document. It is a simple HTML
code:

> \<html\>
>
> \<head\>
>
> \<title\> My First JavaScript Example \</title\>
>
> \</head\>
>
> \<body\>
>
> \<h1\>The Planetary System\</h1\>
>
> \</body\>
>
> \</html\>

2.  Create a \<script\> tag after a \<title\> tag before closing the
    \</head\> tag in the head section:

> \<html\>
>
> \<head\>
>
> \<title\> My First JavaScript Example \</title\>
>
> \<script type=\"text/javascript\"\>\</script\>
>
> \</head\>
>
> \<body\>
>
> \<h1\>The Planetary System\</h1\>
>
> \</body\>
>
> \</html\>

[]{#_bookmark333 .anchor}*Chapter 8*

3.  Insert alert(\"hello world\"); document.write(\'\<h2\>This text has
    been added by JavaScript!\</h2\>\'); within the script tags.

4.  The alert attribute is a JavaScript function that creates a popup
    with the message written inside the quotes and parentheses. The
    message is treated as a string passed to the alert function.
    Similarly, document.write is a JavaScript function that outputs the
    given string on the webpage.

> \<html\>
>
> \<head\>
>
> \<title\> My First JavaScript Example \</title\>
>
> \<script type=\"text/javascript\"\> alert(\"Hello Earthlings\");
>
> document.write(\'\<h2\>Greetings from Mars!\</h2\>\');
>
> \</script\>
>
> \</head\>
>
> \<body\>
>
> \<h1\>The Planetary System\</h1\>
>
> \</body\>
>
> \</html\>

5.  Double-click on the index.html file to execute and open it in the
    browser. A

> popup will appear with an alert message.
>
> Click on **OK** to close the alert box and the webpage will be
> displayed.
>
> This was your first step into the world of JavaScript, although it was
> very basic and did not show the real power of JavaScript. We will be
> practicing advanced JavaScript code in the chapters that follow.

### Server-side JavaScript

> The server is responsible for serving web pages in programming
> languages. The client sends a request to the server with a command,
> and the server responds to that client request. Server-side
> programming is the name given to programs that run on the server. We
> will study this in further detail in *Chapter 11*, *Extending
> JavaScript and ECMA Script 6*.
>
> The term *server-side* means that the control over webpages is handled
> by web servers rather than web pages. Web crossing runs that script
> and sends information in the form of HTML to each user\'s browsers.
>
> []{#_bookmark334 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*
>
> **Rhino** and **Node** are both commonly used to create servers.
> Server-side scripting is not downloaded to client\'s browser.

#### Server side

> Server side refers to operations that are performed by the server in a
> client--server relationship in a computer networking. The term *server
> side* can also be understood as anything outside of the browser.

#### Client side

> Anything that is at *client side* means that it is running inside the
> web browser.

#### Scripting with Rhino

> Rhino is a JavaScript engine/interpreter developed and written in the
> Java language and managed by the Mozilla foundation
> (<http://www.mozilla.org/rhino>) as open source software. It enables
> and allows JavaScript program elements to access the complete Java
> API.

##### Description

> Rhino is a JavaScript open source implementation written in pure Java.
> Rhino is used to provide scripting to end users. Basically, Rhino
> converts JavaScript scripts into classes. It is used for server-side
> programming in JavaScript.
>
> MDN mentions the following: \"Scripting Java has many uses. It allows
> us to write powerful scripts quickly by making use of the many Java
> libraries available.\" More information on things such as the this
> statement would extend the general statement and give some insight
> into the this statement\'s implementation and its purpose.
>
> We can use Rhino scripting as a shell for acting like a debugger. This
> shell runs code in a batch mode. Batch mode refers to batch
> processing, which means automated processing without human
> intervention. Batch is the opposite of interactive.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image60.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365813648293963in"}Being open source, Rhino is a free
> program provided by Mozilla and can be downloaded from
> <http://www.mozilla.org/rhino>. Rhino is distributed as a JAR file. To
> start it with a command line, you can execute the Rhino JAR on a file
> from the command-line interface:
>
> **java -jar rhino1_7R3/js.jar programfiles.js**
>
> The 1.7R2 version of Rhino uses ECMAScript 3, while the 1.7R3 version
> of Rhino partially uses ECMAScript 5. The latest stable release of
> Rhino is 1.7R5, which was released on January 29, 2015.

#### Node.js

> Node.js is an implementation of JavaScript that allows JavaScript to
> run outside the browser and perform OS-based and network-based tasks.
> It is a runtime interface for JavaScript.
>
> Node uses Google V8, which implements ECMAScript 5 standards, meaning
> that there is not much difference between the syntax of JavaScript and
> Node. For example, if you want to print out \"Hello World\" in the
> console, you will write the following:

> console.log(\"Hello from Mars!\"); //This is same for JavaScript as
> well.

##### Description

> Node.js is a super fast interface that runs on the Google Chrome V8
> engine. Node.js is easy to use, fast, and scalable. Like JavaScript
> client-side programming, Node.js provides abstraction. So, by this
> abstraction, Node.js can handle a huge amount of code.
>
> Here is an example or server-side coding in Node.js:
>
> var http=require(\"http\");
> http.createServer(function(request,response){

## The language syntax

> The language syntax is basically a means of communication. In a
> programming language, it\'s a formal way of communicating with
> algorithms, from both algorithms to programmer and programmer to
> machine. This is because a machine works on given instructions.
>
> These instructions are meant to be written in a specific format, so
> that a machine could understand and compile it properly. That specific
> format is defined by some general rules of a programming language,
> known as language syntax.
>
> A computer contains a list of instructions to be executed. Every
> computer language has different syntax and rules. To use different
> languages, we must have knowledge of their language syntax, such as
> the following:

-   Syntax (a set of symbols and rules)

-   Semantics (for transforming term to term)

-   Pragmatics (the particular construct of a language)

> Similarly, other languages in JavaScript have a unique syntax.
> JavaScript is not a language of Java; these are two different
> languages and the syntaxes for
>
> both languages are different. JavaScript is a powerful and expressive
> language. JavaScript\'s statements are separated by a semicolon at the
> end.

[]{#_bookmark337 .anchor}*Chapter 8*

> The JavaScript language syntax is much easy for beginners who have an
> idea of object-oriented programming. JavaScript is contained between
> the \<scripts\>...\</ script\> tags. These are treated as HTML tags in
> any web browser.
>
> You can place your JavaScript code anywhere on your webpage, but I
> prefer the way of defining your script using the \<head\> tag. So, the
> structure of your script will be as follows:
>
> \<head\>
>
> \<script\>

.................

\</script\>

> \</head\>
>
> Basically, the \<script\> tag when written writing \<head\> tag, tells
> the browser that this scripts need to be executed first when the web
> page loads. Although, its a good practice to include javaScript is to
> place it at the bottom of a web page. There are two important
> attributes of this script tag.

### Language

> The language attribute will tell which language attribute you are
> using; typically, it\'s JavaScript. It is the default value if the
> attribute is absent.

### Type {#type-2}

> The type attribute is the same as the preceding explanation. This is
> not a required attribute. Its value is set as text/javascript, which
> shows that this scripting language is in use.
>
> \<script language=\" javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\"\>
>
> .Script code.
>
> \</script\>

## The character set

> A character set is basically a list of characters recognized by
> computer hardware and software. It is represented by a number. Earlier
> ASCII was used as standard character set encoding for web pages. There
> were lots of character encoding problems that were almost solved after
> the arrival of HTML5 and XML. JavaScript provides support for
> different types of languages and their characters. The character set
> attribute shows the character encoding in external files. For HTML5,
> there is a default character set encoding is UTF-8.
>
> []{#_bookmark338 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*
>
> There are some common values of character set encoding such as the
> following:

-   **ISO-8859-1**: This is used to encode the Latin alphabet

-   **UTF-8**: This is used for Unicode encoding that is compatible with
    ASCII

> For example, if your frontend page is in Spanish, and you do not use
> the character set property in your page, then it will not show some
> special characters in Spanish clearly. For this, you must declare a
> character set property in the top \<head\> tag of your page, as
> follows:
>
> \<meta charset=\"utf-8\"\>?
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image61.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365824584426947in"}For this, you can also change your web
> server\'s configuration to serve as UTF-8. Alternatively, we can send
> a content-type header to our server-side script.
>
> In JavaScript, the charset property returns the character encoding of
> the current document. The syntax for reading the characterSet property
> from the document is document.characterSet;.
>
> We can define the characterSet attribute in the \<script\> tag in the
> parent page of our website, as follows:
>
> \<script type=\"text/javascript\"charset=\"utf-8\"\>\</script\>
>
> Another way is to add the UTF-8 character set into the server
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image62.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365748031496063in"}configuration file (.htaccess), as
> follows:
>
> **AddCharset UTF-8**
>
> So, character set encoding will apply to all JavaScript pages in your
> application.

#### Case sensitivity

> HTML is not a case-sensitive language, but XML and JavaScript are case
> sensitive languages.

##### Description

> JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. Case sensitivity in
> JavaScript does not only apply to variable names but also to
> JavaScript keywords and JavaScript\'s event handlers. For example, if
> you have the firstname and firstName variables, then these will be two
> different variables. In JavaScript, while calling a function, you must
> write its name exactly the same way as it was defined, matching the
> letter case.

[]{#_bookmark339 .anchor}*Chapter 8*

> A popular convention also used in JavaScript\'s primitive methods is
> to use camel case, in which a phrase is written with the first letter
> of the first word in lowercase and every successive word has an
> uppercase first letter, which makes it easier to read.
>
> Examples of some functions are as follows:

-   toUpper();

-   toArray();

> JavaScript has functions that are built into the language; they take
> strings and transform them to the uppercase or lowercase. This can

-   .toUpperCase()

-   .toLowerCase()

#### Whitespaces and line breaks

> Whitespaces and line breaks are used to format and indent code in a
> neat and consistent manner so that the code becomes readable and easy
> to understand.

##### Description

> Spaces, Tabs, New lines which are not a part of a string are called
> whitespaces. JavaScript removes whitespaces and line breaks between
> tokens in the programs,
>
> Spaces and Line breaks that are a part of a string are not removed
> when script is executed.
>
> In any text, there are three types of line breaks:\\r\\n or as \\r or
> \\n. These line breaks occur in different types of operating systems:

-   \\r\\n is usually created on Windows

-   \\n is usually created on OS X

> []{#_bookmark340 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*
>
> If you want to remove line breaks from any text, then we must deal
> with all types of line breaks because the text could be from these
> three sources Windows, Linux, and Mac.
>
> We have several methods to remove line breaks from any text. For
> example, we have the following:
>
> varabc = abc.replace(/(\\r\\n\|\\n\|\\r)/gm,\"\");
>
> In this code, we have used a regular expression for removing line
> breaks from our text. This will remove line breaks \\r\\n, then \\n,
> and finally \\r. We used the suffix gm at the end of the regular
> expression because m shows that line breaks should be removed from all
> the text and g shows that it should be done more than once.
>
> Regular expressions are discussed in detail in *Chapter 8*,
> *JavaScript Expressions, Operators, Statements, and Arrays*.
>
> Now, there are some spaces between texts; you can remove these
> whitespaces using JavaScript. There are different functions of
> JavaScript for removing all leading spaces from a string; you can use
> the following:
>
> str = str.replace(/\^\\s+\|\\s+\$/g,\'\');
>
> This piece of code uses a regular expression, which checks multiple
> occurrences of white spaces at beginning and end of string.
>
> The g in this regular expression shows that the global search should
> be performed while checking the text. There are more methods, such as
> the following:

-   The string.replace() function is used to replace all leading
    whitespaces with an empty string

-   The str.trim() function is used to remove spaces from both sides of
    a string

#### The Unicode escape sequence

> Every Unicode escape sequence consists of six characters with a much
> defined syntax: four characters following \\u. Smaller code is
> accompanied by leading zeroes but the length of the sequence is
> maintained. For example, \\u00a9 has two leading zeros. Similarly, the
> copyright symbol can be represented as \\u00A9.
>
> Any character with a code point that is less than 65536 can be escaped
> using the hexadecimal value of its code point, prefixed with \\u.

[]{#_bookmark341 .anchor}*Chapter 8*

> ![](./images-ref/media/image64.png){width="0.41784120734908137in"
> height="0.3365780839895013in"}A code point (also known as **character
> code**) is a numerical representation
>
> of a specific Unicode character.

##### Description

> The JavaScript Unicode escape sequence allows you to place special
> characters in a string. Browsers that support JavaScript can use the
> escape function.
>
> To add the next line within the same string, we can use \\n. Let\'s
> take a look at the following code:
>
> alert(\"Welcome to JavaScript. \\n We hope you love it!\")
>
> To add quotes within a string, we can use something like this:
>
> var myquote=\"Jinnah said \\\"Impossible is a word unknown to
> me.\\\"\"
>
> This Unicode escape sequence starts with a backslash (\\) followed by
> characters. This backslash is the escape sequence character. To insert
> a backslash itself, just add another backslash \"\\\" before the next
> one. Also called double backslash (\\\\).
>
> You can specify a Unicode character by \\uaaaa, where aaaa is a
> hexadecimal number. So a Unicode escape character can represent a
> 16-bit character.
>
> A Unicode escape sequence represents a Unicode sequence, as follows:

-   A backslash (\\)

-   A character (u)

-   A hexadecimal number (0-9)(a-f)

> For example, the word cat will be represented as \\u732b.
>
> A Unicode escape sequence can also be used in comments and literals.
> Consider the following example:
>
> var x = \"http\\\\u00253A\\\\u00252F\\\\u00252Fexample.com\";
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image65.png){width="0.4178423009623797in"
> height="0.336576990376203in"}The hexadecimal part of this kind of a
> character escape is case-insensitive, which means \\u041a and \\u041A
> are equivalent.
>
> []{#_bookmark342 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*
>
> You can also represent an escape sequence to represent a Unicode
> character \[\"\\ u03b1\"\] as \[\"a\"\].The Unicode escape for the
> character é, for example, is \\u00E9, and the following two JavaScript
> strings are identical:
>
> \"cafn\" === \"caf\\u00e9\" // =\> true
>
> The == operator tries to convert the values to the same type before
> testing if they\'re the same; whereas, === does not do this. It
> requires objects to be of the same type to be equal.
>
> Here are some examples of the escape sequence for some characters:

+---------------+------------------+----------------------------------+

#### Normalization

> The Unicode standard (which can be found at
> [http://unicode.org/standard/](http://unicode.org/standard/standard.html)
> [standard.html](http://unicode.org/standard/standard.html)) defines
> the most acceptable pattern of encoding characters and the
> normalization method. Javascript presupposes that the code it is
> reading and interpreting has all the Unicode representations
> normalized. ECMAScript V6 has a
>
> string prototype function (string.prototype.normalize()) to fix any
> unaddressed
>
> encodings.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image66.png){width="0.4178423009623797in"
> height="0.33658683289588803in"}ECMAScript 6 introduces
> String.prototype.normalize(), which takes care of Unicode
> normalization.

### Identifiers

> *Chapter 8*
>
> Identifiers are used to give names to functions and variables. There
> are certain rules for these identifiers and these rules are the same
> for all programming languages.
>
> Identifiers can contain letters and a digest of the complete Unicode
> character set. These JavaScript identifiers include variables,
> objects, functions, properties, methods, events, and so on.
>
> Here are the rules for identifiers:

-   Identifiers cannot start with a number

-   Identifiers can contain numbers, letters, underscore, and the dollar
    sign (\$)

-   It can be of any length

-   These are case-sensitive

-   We must not use reserved words for identifiers

> ![](./images-ref/media/image67.png){width="0.39665244969378827in"
> height="0.4954494750656168in"}We can also use Unicode characters as
> identifiers. Unicode escape sequences such as \\uaaaa, can also be
> used as identifiers. We must avoid using global methods or properties
> as identifiers.
>
> A best practice while writing identifiers is to use one word and use
>
> camel case. Consider the following example:

-   myNote

-   myNewNotebook

-   \$sum

> The var variable is a valid identifier name, but it is an invalid
> identifier because of the reserved word. If you use a valid
> identifier, then your browser will handle it correctly; however, if
> you use an invalid identifier, your browser will show a warning
> recognizing it as a bug.

### Reserved keywords

> Reserved words are keywords in JavaScript. There are some words that
> cannot be used as a function or a variable name. These reserved words
> are also identifiers. These reserved words are reserved for JavaScript
> engine. If you use these reserved words as a function, variable, or a
> method name, then your browser will show a warning and your script may
> fail.
>
> Reserved words are basically keywords that have special meaning in
> JavaScript, for example, break, case, do, delete, else, and so on.
>
> []{#_bookmark344 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*
>
> There are three types of reserved words:

-   Protected reserved words

-   New reserved word

-   Future reserved words

#### Protected reserved words

> Protected reserved words cannot be used as a variable or a function
> name. If we use these, then there will be a compilation error in it.
> Here are a few protected reserved words:

+------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
| > Break                | > case                | > catch             |
+========================+=======================+=====================+
| > class                | > const               | > Continue          |
+------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
| > Debugger             | > Default             | > Delete            |
+------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
| > do                   | > Else                | > Export            |
+------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
| > Extends              | > False               | > If                |
+------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+
| > Import               | > in                  | > var               |
+------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+

#### New reserved words

> JavaScript also released new keywords, and these reserved words have a
> special meaning for the current version of JavaScript. These reserved
> keywords can also be used as identifiers. Once you declare it as an
> identifier, then it will forget that it was a keyword. Here are some
> examples of new reserved keywords:

+------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------+
| > Abstract             | > Boolean               | > byte            |
+========================+=========================+===================+
| > char                 | > enum                  | > final           |
+------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------+
| > doubke               | > implements            | > int             |
+------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------+
| > interface            | > internal              | > long            |
+------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------+
| > set                  | > short                 | > static          |
+------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------+
| > uint                 | > ulong                 | > ushort          |
+------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------+

#### Future reserved words

> *Chapter 8*
>
> Future reserved words are proposed for future extensions of
> JavaScript. These are also used as an identifier in the current
> version of JavaScript. When you choose a word as an identifier, it is
> also important to note whether it is already the name of JavaScript
> reserved keyword. Here are some examples of future reserved words:

+---------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| > asset                         | > event                            |
+=================================+====================================+
| > namespace                     | > require                          |
+---------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| > transient                     | > violate                          |
+---------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| > ensure                        | > goto                             |
+---------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| > native                        | > synchronized                     |
+---------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| > use                           | > Invariant                        |
+---------------------------------+------------------------------------+

### Comments

> In any programming language, comments are used to make your code
> readable. In JavaScript, comments are used to explain JavaScript code.
>
> Another use of comments is to write them to add hints, suggestions,
> and warnings into our JavaScript code, so if someone other than the
> developer wants to change or modify your script, they can easily
> modify it. Use of comments in a script is considered as a best
> practice. Comments are also used to disable the execution of some
> parts of code. In debugging, comments are very helpful, so it is a
> valuable debugging tool for developers.
>
> There are three different types of comments you can put into your
> JavaScript script:

-   Multiple-line comments

-   One-line comments

-   The HTML comment opening sequence

#### Multiple-line comments

> We can write multiple lines between the comment boundaries; this block
> of code will not be executed:
>
> /\* this is a comment \*/
>
> []{#_bookmark346 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*

#### One-line comments

> Adding two forward slashes in the beginning of the line comments it.
> The text between // and the end of the line is commented and will not
> be compiled. Double forward slash is used to comment one line at a
> time:
>
> // this is comment

#### The HTML comment opening sequence

> JavaScript treats the HTML comment\'s opening sequence, that is,
> \<!\-- as // comment. It does not recognize the closing sequence of
> HTML comment, that is, \--\> HTML styled comments are not usually used
> within JavaScript code blocks as // is much handy. It is recommended
> not to use HTML comments in JS as that was an old practice. They were
> used to hide incompatible JavaScript code from old browsers.

### Literals

> Literals are used to represent values for the different data
> structures in JavaScript; for example:

-   3.14

-   to be or not to be

> In the following sections, we will cover the literal types for
> JavaScript.

#### Object literals

> An object literal is used to hold values in an object.

##### Description

> An object literal holds pairs of comma-separated lists of property
> names and associated values, and they are enclosed within {}. It is
> possible for an object literal to have no values as well. In an object
> literal, each name:value pair is separated by a comma.
>
> Here is an example of an object literal:
>
> varbookObj={
>
> bookName=\"The Kite Runner\", CoverImage=\"KiteRunner1.png\",
> Author=\"KhaledHoesenni\", bookCategory =\"Bestseller\"
>
> };

[]{#_bookmark347 .anchor}*Chapter 8*

#### Array literals

> An array literal contains a list of expressions that represent an
> array element.

##### Description

> Array literals contain values inside an array. They are placed inside
> array brackets \[\] and each element is separated by a comma (,). Just
> like an object literal, an array can be empty and contain 0 elements.
> When you create an array literal it is specified values as its element
> and its length is specified as a number of arguments of this array.
> Here is an example of an array literal:
>
> var Planets= \[\"Earth\", \"Neptune\", \"Saturn\", \"Mars\"\];

#### Boolean literals

> As the name suggests, a Boolean literal has Boolean values, so its
> value is either true
>
> or false.

#### Integers

> Integer literals must contain values that are only integers.

##### Description

> In JavaScript, an integer literal must contain a digit from 0 to 9.
> Commas and brackets are not allowed in integer literals. Integers can
> be negative or positive. If there is no sign present then it is
> consider as positive.

#### Floating point literals

> A floating point literal is used to contain floating numbers---numbers
> that have a decimal point, fraction, or exponent.

##### Description

> Examples of floating point literals are as follows:
>
> 22.56
>
> -26.35689
>
> 18.4e2 //Equivalent to \[18.4 x 10\^2\]
>
> -17.22E3 //Equivalent to \[17.22 x 10\^-3\]
>
> []{#_bookmark348 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*

#### String literals

> String literals, as the name suggests, hold only string values, that
> is, values placed inside a pair of quotation marks.

##### Description

> A string literal contains characters placed inside quotation marks.
> You can also create a null string to not contain anything. Two or more
> strings can be joined together using the + sign. Special characters
> can be inserted in the string. A few special characters are \\n, \\r,
> \\b, \\t, to name a few.
>
> A few examples of string examples are as follows:
>
> strFirstName= \"Jamie\"; strLastName=\"Down\";
> strMarksObtained=\"200\";
>
> strClassesJoined=\"Microprocessors, \"+ \"Microcontrollers\";
> strAddress= \"Michigan University \\n United States\";

### Statements

> JavaScript also supports a set of statements used to identify a set of
> instructions and carry out tasks. There are different types of
> statements in JavaScript such as if, for, while, and so on. The basic
> purpose of using these statements is to evaluate or check whether
> certain conditions are being met. These statements are common for all
> programming languages.

#### Conditional statements

> As the name suggests, conditional statements are based on conditions
> and the if and then rule. For example, \"if you work hard, you will
> get rewarded\". Here, working hard is the condition of getting
> rewarded.
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> if (age \< 20 && age \> 12) { person = \"Teen ager\";
>
> }
>
> else {
>
> person = \"Not a Teenager\";
>
> }

[]{#_bookmark349 .anchor}*Chapter 8*

#### The loop statement

> In a loop statement, a condition is provided within a set of
> parentheses. If the condition evaluates to true, then the loop will
> continue working, and if the
>
> condition equates to false, the program will jump to the next line
> after the loop. An exception is the do while loop, which will always
> execute at least once. There are different types of loops in
> programming languages; they are as follows:

-   The for loops

-   The for/in loops

-   The while loops

-   The do/while loops

> Here is an example that shows how the while loop is used:
>
> var number = \"\"; var n = 0;
>
> while (n \< 10) {
>
> number += \"\\nThe number is \" + n; n++;
>
> }
>
> console.log(number);
>
> Loops are covered in more detail in *Chapter 8*, *JavaScript
> Expressions, Operators, Statements, and Arrays*.

#### Object manipulation statements

> Object manipulation statements in JavaScript are used to access the
> object\'s properties and methods at runtime to perform certain
> functions. JavaScript uses the for...in and with statements to
> manipulate objects.
>
> Here is an example that shows how the object car can be manipulated:
>
> \<script type=\"text/javascript\"\> var x;
>
> var car = new Object(); car.brand = \"Porche\"; car.model = \"2014\";
> car.colour = \"Black\"; for (x in car) {
>
> console,log(x + \" \-\-- \" + car\[x\] + \"\<br /\>\");
>
> }
>
> \</script\>
>
> []{#_bookmark350 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*
>
> Output:
>
> brand --- Porche model --- 2014 color --- Black

#### Exception handling statements

> The try, catch, throw, and finally statements are used in JavaScript
> exception handling. Let\'s take a look at the following description:

-   The try statement tests code for errors.

-   The catch statement usually follows the try statement and catches
    and handles the error found in the try block.

-   The throw statement creates custom errors or alerts.

-   The finally statement executes code after try and catch, regardless
    of the result. Usually, this block of code is used to clean up and
    release resources.

> Here is an example showing how exceptions are handled using the try
> and catch
>
> block:
>
> \<!DOCTYPE html\>
>
> \<html\>
>
> \<head\>
>
> \<script type=\"text/javascript\"\>
>
> \<!\--
>
> function Calculate() {
>
> x = document.getElementById(\"Val1\").value; y =
> document.getElementById(\"Val2\").value;
>
> try{
>
> if ( x == 0 \|\|y==0 ) { throw(\"Divide by zero error.\" );
>
> }
>
> else {
>
> var a = x / y;
>
> alert(\"The answer is: \" + a );
>
> }
>
> catch ( err ) {

[]{#_bookmark351 .anchor}*Chapter 8*

> alert(\"Error: \" + err );
>
> }
>
> }
>
> //\--\>
>
> \</script\>
>
> \</head\>
>
> \<body\>
>
> \<form\>
>
> \<p\>Enter first value\</p\>
>
> \<input id=\"Val1\" type=\"text\"\>
>
> \<p\>Enter second value\</p\>
>
> \<input id=\"Val2\" type=\"text\"\>
>
> \<p\>\<input type=\"button\" value=\"Calculate\"
> onclick=\"Calculate();\" /\>\</p\>
>
> \</form\>
>
> \</body\>
>
> \</html\>

### Optional semicolon

> Semicolons in JavaScript are used to separate statements from each
> other. Let\'s say, if you have two different statements and you just
> write them, then it will not be understandable. So, JavaScript uses
> semicolons to separate statements. It will make your code clear and
> meaningful. If you do not use semicolon in JavaScript, then it will
> make your statements complex, meaning that the end of one of your
> statements could be the start of your statement.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image68.png){width="0.41784120734908137in"
> height="0.3365748031496063in"}Placing semicolons in your code can help
> you prevent a lot of errors. Absence of semicolons, from your code
> block will treat it as a single line of code when compiled resulting
> in several errors.
>
> JavaScript does not consider a line break as a semicolon. Here is an
> example of the use of semicolons in JavaScript:

> a=10; b=20;
>
> a=10; b=20;

> height="0.33658683289588803in"}A semicolon in JavaScript is not a
> terminator; these are just separators used to separate statements.
>
> JavaScript automatically inserts a semicolon at the end of your
> statement. You should not put a semicolon after the closing curly
> bracket. Similarly, at times, putting a semicolon after round brackets
> ()is also a bad idea, and importantly, the code will not run.
>
> If there is a for loop in your script, then put a semicolon after the
> first and second statements and don\'t put a semicolon after third
> statement. It will produce a syntax error. For example, if you have a
> for loop like this:
>
> for(i=0;i\<5;i++;){}
>
> The preceding code will give you a syntax error. The right way of
> doing this is as follows:
>
> for(i=0;i\<5;i++){}
>
> Here are some rules for semicolons:

-   Insert a semicolon when an assignment operator is used

-   Insert a semicolon after rite operand of assignment operator

-   Insert a semicolon after a closing round bracket of a function

-   Insert a semicolon after keywords

-   When you declare a variable insert a semicolon

## Data type

> A computer works on a set of given instructions; it cannot
> differentiate between a number and a character. For example, if you
> write some numbers, such as 12345, and some character, abcsd, it
> cannot tell integers from characters. So, data types are used for
> this. The datatype tells which type of data is being used or
> referenced in a statement.

> There are six major data types defined in ECMAScript standard.

-   Null

-   Undefined

-   Boolean

-   String

-   Symbol

-   Number

### The typeof operator

> Operators are used to find the type of a JavaScript variable. For
> example, you have two numbers variables, as follows:
>
> 5+1=6
>
> Here, 5 and 1 are operands and + is an operator. The syntax of this
> operator is as follows:
>
> Typeof(operand)
>
> []{#_bookmark354 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*

#### Description

> The Typeof operator is a unary operator; it returns a string that
> indicates the typeof expressions. The typeof operator returns
> information as a string. There are six possible values that can be
> returned as a string. They are string, number, object, function,
> Boolean, and undefined.
>
> Here are some examples of the typeof operator:

-   typeof(\"5\"+\"1\"): This will return a string

-   typeof(5+1): This will return a number

-   typeof(5+\"1\"): This will return a string

-   typeof(5\*\"1\"): This will return a number

> ![](./images-ref/media/image71.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.336576990376203in"}The typeof operator is not a function.
> Operands are written in round brackets, so it looks like a function,
> but these are not functions. When you use the typeofnull operator, it
> returns an object.

### The undefined type

> In JavaScript, an empty variable or a variable without values has an
> undefined value. And, typeof is also undefined. If you want to empty a
> variable, you can assign it an undefined value; for example:
>
> var employee = undefined;

#### Description

> In JavaScript, undefined is a property of the global object. This
> means that the
>
> value is undefined and we declare it in the global scope of the
> browser.
>
> There are basically three property attributes of undefined:

-   Writeable

-   Enumerable

-   Configurable

> These three property attributes show that, for modern browsers, these
> properties are not writeable, enumerable, and configurable. And, we
> should avoid overriding these properties. The undefined type is a
> primitive type in JavaScript.

> height="0.33658683289588803in"}The Undefined type shows that a
> variable has not been assigned a value. All browsers, such as Firefox,
> Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari, support the undefined property
> according to ECMAScript.
>
> Undefined is a built-in type in the JavaScript library. Every type of
> function for which the value is not defined is consider as an
> undefined type. For example, if you have a function without the return
> statement, the result of that function will be considered as
> undefined.
>
> Being a property of a global object, its value is initially undefined.
> We can access it as a global variable, although it\'s a global
> property. A simple idea of an undefined type is when a variable is not
> defined in your script, but it does exist and you are considering it
> as a global variable.
>
> Whenever a function executes in a script, and it finishes executing
> without returning
>
> a value, then it returns the undefined type, for example:
>
> var abc, f1=function(){} f2=function() {
>
> var hello; return hello;
>
> }
>
> typeof(abc) ; // undefined typeof(f1); // function typeof(f2); //
> function
>
> Here, in this example, the variable abc is defined but no value has
> been assigned to it. Notice that undefined type is a primitive
> property of a object declared in a global scope. Here, defining it as
> a global object does not mean that it cannot be redefined. It can be
> redefined according to ECMAScript. So, undefined is not a reserved
> word; it can be used as a variable name in other scopes outside of its
> global scope.
>
> When you use comparison operators, you can also declare the undefined
> type there to know whether a variable has a value or not.

### The null type

> In JavaScript, null shows an empty value. Here is the syntax:
>
> varabc; // Here abc does not exist and it has been not initialized

> varabc=null; // Here abc exist but it does not has a value or a type
>
> []{#_bookmark356 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,

#### Description

> The data type of null is an object in JavaScript. Null shows that
> value does not exist in the script. When you want to empty a value,

> null and undefined type. The data type of null is an object and the
> data type of undefined is undefined. In the identity operator, null
> cannot be undefined,
>
> but in the equality operator, null can be undefined. This is because
> the equality operator will cast the value on the left to the same type

>
> console.log(typeof abc); //returns object

### The number type

> There is only one type of number in JavaScript. Numbers can be written
> with or without
>
> decimals. Much larger or smaller numbers can be written with
> scientific notation.

#### Description

> *Chapter 8*
>
> Unlike other programming languages where we have several numeric data
> types like integer, float, double, and so on. JavaScript has a Number
> data type for all numeric values. JavaScript has three symbolic values
> for this type: infinity, and NaN (not
>
> a valid number). NaN defined in the number type in JavaScript shows
> that it is a
>
> reserved word, and its value is not a number in reality.
>

> height="0.3365758967629046in"}There is no difference between an
> integer and a floating point value
>
> in JavaScript.
>
> Integer values can be positive numbers, 0, or negative numbers. They
> can be of any base number like base 10, 16, or 8. But mostly, in
> JavaScript, numbers are written to base 10. To check the largest or
> smallest number representable or available in JavaScript, you can use
> constants of maximum and minimum values:

> Number.maxValue Number.minValue

> ![](./images-ref/media/image75.png){width="0.4178423009623797in"
> height="0.3365813648293963in"} In Firefox or Chrome, it is
> Number.MAX_VALUE.
>
> In the number type, you only check a number that has two
> representations, for example, if you have the number 0, then it has
> two representations---one is -0 and the other is +0. JavaScript
> numbers can be written with or without a decimal point; for example:
>
> A non- decimal number var a=10
>
> A number with decimal var b=10.0123
>
> If the number is too large or too short, then we use a scientific
> notation\'s exponent for
>
> it. Consider the following example:
>
> If we have a number 100000000 var a=1000e5
>
> And 0.00111
>
> var b=111e-5
>
> The limit is 1e+21 (the console displays a scientific notation from
> the power of 10).

### The Boolean type

> In programming languages, the Boolean type works on the Boolean logic
> in which variables return results as true or false. These true and
> false are basically literals. The Boolean logic is used usually in
> comparison operators, for example, lesser or greater than, and so on.
>
> Any variable can be assigned a Boolean value written as true or false
> in lower case.

#### Description

> In JavaScript, when you declare a Boolean data type to a variable,
> then the variable should not have any quote. Here is how you should
> use boolean assignment: var abc
>
> = \"true\"; //string assignment and var abc = true; //boolean
> assignment. The Boolean variables are also used in the if, if then
> else, and while loop.
>
> Here is an example showing how Boolean variables are used:
>
> var x=true; if(x==true) {
>
> document.write(\"this true\");
>
> }
>
> The Boolean operators are also used when there is a lack of or
> presence of a value. For example, if we have a checkbox in our script,
> then its value is present or not depending on whether it is checked or
> not.
>
> In other data types, there is an unlimited number of values a variable
> can take, but for the Boolean data types, there are only two---true
> and false. This data type is usually used when we have a controlled
> structure such as a comparison, the if else loop, and the while loop.
> These are controlled structures. The If and else statement performs
> one action if the value is true; otherwise, it will perform another
> action, that is, false.

[]{#_bookmark359 .anchor}*Chapter 8*

> You can also use the Boolean data type as a comparative expression. A
> comparative expression is an expression that evaluates 0, null, and
> undefined as false and other values as true. Consider the following
> example:
>
> C=A+B
>
> In this example, the result of A+B is stored in C first and then this
> expression is evaluated. If you want to check that the C value is
> equal to A+B, then you must use the comparison operator for this, as
> follows:
>
> C==A+B

### The string type

> In JavaScript, anything that is written between quotes is treated as a
> string. Double or single quotes can be used.
>
> Strings literals can be defined in two ways. One way is to write a
> string in double
>
> quotes and the other way is to write a string in single quotes.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image77.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365748031496063in"}There is no special type of
> representation of a single character in JavaScript. If you want to
> represent a single character in JavaScript, then you must define a
> single character string, for example, the character a. An empty string
> is a zero length string, for example \"\".

#### Description

> In JavaScript, the text data is represented in the form of the string
> data type. In programming languages, string is a combination of
> characters and numbers. A JavaScript string is an ordered sequence of
> zero or more characters.
>
> The restriction for writing these strings is that you must use the
> same quotation mark at the beginning and end. This means that a string
> that starts with a single quote must end with a single quote, and the
> same rule applies for double quotation marks. Consider the following
> example:
>
> var x=\"xyz\" //double quotes var y=\'xyz\' //single quotes var z=\"\"
> //empty string
>
> []{#_bookmark360 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*
>
> If there is a problem in a string and it cannot show some characters.
> For a representation of these characters, there is a technique in
> JavaScript---we define the escape sequence for this. This means that
> the character which we cannot write directly is written using an
> escape sequence. For example, if we want to insert a quotation mark
> within a string, we can do it by preceding quotation mark with a
> backslash. It is known as escaping the quotation mark. Similarly,
> string literals are unable to represent nonprinting characters such as
> tab, new line, and so on.
>
> An escape sequence is a combination of characters starting with a
> backslash. Some escape sequences are as follows:

-   \\b: BackspaceDeletes the previous character and moves cursor one
    space backwards.

-   \\n: New lineEnds the current line and moves the cursor to a new
    line. If used in the middle of a string it will move the text after
    \\n to new line.

-   \\f: Form feedIt is a page-break ASCII control character. It tells
    printer to continue printing on new page.

-   \\v: Vertical tabIt was used to control the vertical movement on
    page. It is rarely used now.

-   \\t: Horizontal tab control the insertion of text horizontally on
    page. It is inserted usually using the *Tab* key on the keyboard.

-   \\\" : Double QuotesA double quotes is preceded with a backslash to
    insert it within a string.

-   \\\' : Single QuotesA single quotes is preceded with a backslash to
    insert it within a string.

-   \\\\: Backslash to insert a backslash within a string we escape it
    with another backslash.

>
> var abc = \"hello \\n Morning\"

> Its output will be as follows:
>
> Hello Morning

### The object type

> Object is a sequence of primitive and, sometimes, reference data types
> stored as name-value pairs.
>
> The syntax is as follows:
>
> varsomeObj= {property:value};

#### Description

> *Chapter 8*
>
> In JavaScript, objects are written into curly brackets. Each item of
> an object is called a **property**. Property values can be defined as
> any valid data type as well as functions or methods. Consider the
> following example:
>
> varobj= {book_name:\"xyz\", Author:\"abc\"};
>
> We can say that the object is a list of items, and each item in the
> list has some method and function stored as its name-value pair:
>
> In JavaScript, everything is like an object, for example:

-   Regular expressions are objects

-   Numbers are objects

-   Strings are objects

-   Mathematical notations are objects

-   Arrays and functions are objects

-   Objects are objects

> The property name of any item can be a string or number. When a
> property is a number, then the way of writing this property is
> different; we will write it as follows:
>
> var age = {\"30\": \"abc\"};
>
> In JavaScript, objects are used to store data and for writing your own
> custom methods and functions. Primitive values are, for example, null,
> undefined, true, and false else.
>
> Object properties are basically variables that are used in methods and
> function internally. They can also be global variables for the whole
> page. There is a difference between a method and a function. A
> function is a standalone unit of an object, but a method is attached
> to an object and it is used with this keyword:
>
> Document.write (\"hello world\");

## Variable, scope, and memory

> When we describe a variable in JavaScript, there is no limit to how
> much data this variable holds. The maximum is described by the
> browser\'s capacity depending on how much data it can hold. Let\'s
> take a look the following code:
>
> var abc=\"xyz\";
>
> *[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics, and Variable
> Types]{.underline}*
>
> We can define a variable in JavaScript using the var keyword. We can
> define the value of a variable immediately or later. A variable that
> we define outside the boundary of a function is a global variable.
>
> Creating too many global variables in JavaScript is a very bad
> approach.

> height="0.4900721784776903in"}The major reason why global variables
> are discouraged in JavaScript is because in JavaScript, all the code
> shares a single global namespace, also JavaScript has implied global
> variables, that is, variables that are not explicitly declared in
> local scope are automatically included with global namespaces. Relying
> too much on global variables can result in conflicts between various
> scripts on the same page.
>
> Every function in a script can access a global variable. When you
> define a variable in a function, then its scope is inside that
> function. Let\'s take a look at the following code snippet:

> ![](./images-ref/media/image79.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365758967629046in"}The scope of a global variable never
> stops during the execution of the whole page even it is not needed.
>
> If you fail to write var inside the function, then this variable is
> considered as a global variable. If you define a variable with the
> same global variable name, then it will be considered as a global
> variable.
>
> JavaScript dynamically allocates memory to variables. When the scope
> of these variables is dereferenced or finished, it is automatically
> removed from the memory by the garbage collector. So, its disadvantage
> is that the unwanted variables remain in the memory.
>
> There are two ways to save memory:

-   Using the function scope

-   Dereferencing these variables manually

[]{#_bookmark362 .anchor}*Chapter 8*

> The use of the function scope is more appropriate as variables get
> dereferenced when the function ends, thus saving memory:
>
> (Function (window, document, undefined) { varabc=\"abc\";
>
> }
>
> (window, document);

### Variable declaration

> JavaScript variables can be identified by unique names. These unique
> names are known as **identifiers**. Variables in JavaScript are used
> to store information. Identifiers can be of any length and size, for
> example, a, b, myName.
>
> When you declare a variable in JavaScript, the machine will save it in
> the memory so that you can store or retrieve data from memory when
> needed. Variable names should be unique in the script.
>
> The rules to declare variable names in JavaScript are the same as
> those for identifiers,
>
> as discussed previously.
>
> When a code starts its execution, it first processes the variable
> declaration. These variables can be declared globally as well as
> within a function. We can declare multiple comma-separated variables,
> for example:
>
> var myName,myAddress,myContact;
>
> When we store data into a variable, this process is called **variable
> initialization**. We can initialize a variable at the time of its
> creation or later when we want to use it, for example:
>
> var a=1; var b=2; var c; c=a+b;
>
> Here, in this example, the variable a stores the value 1, and b stores
> 2, and then we create the variable c and define its value later.
>
> []{#_bookmark363 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,

### The variable scope

> A variable scope is a frame where a variable exists in a program. We
> can define a scope of a variable in a program. Basically, the scope is
> a set of methods, functions, and objects that we have access to.
>
> There are two scopes of variables in JavaScript:

-   Local scope variables

-   Global scope variables

#### Local scope variables

> A variable when defined inside a function is called a local scope
> variable, as this variable can only be accessed into this function.
> Function variables will be local to this variable.

##### Description

> For a variable, which is defined in the local scope, a variable of the
> same name can be used in a different function. When a function starts,
> the local variable is created and when the function ends, the local
> variable is deleted. In JavaScript, always declare variables before
> using them; failing to do this will throw some exceptions. In a
> function, if you have a local and a global variable with the same
> name, then the local variable will get priority over the global
> variable. So, avoid using the same variable name. Let\'s take a look
> at the following code snippet:
>
> function xyz() { varabc=\"xyz\"; document.write(abc);
>
> }

#### Global scope variables

> A global variable can be declared anywhere in a JavaScript program.
> They can be accessed from everywhere. A global scope variable remains
> in the memory
>
> throughout the execution of scripts on the page. This results in
> memory depletion.

##### Description

> *Chapter 8*
>
> Basically, global variables are window objects. Global variables are
> generally defined outside of the function and all functions in a
> webpage can access this global variable. If you give some value to a
> variable which is not declared, then this variable will be considered
> as a global variable. When you close a web page, the global variable
> will be deleted. For frontend developers in HTML, the window object is
> a global variable.
>
> var abc=\"xyx\"; functionmy Function() {
>
> //some code

> }

### Primitive and reference values

> There are two types of values a variable can have:

-   Primitive type values

-   Reference type values

#### Primitive type values

> Generally objects are aggregated from properties and those properties
> can be used to reference the object. Primitive (value, data type) is
> not an object and has no methods associated to it.

##### Description

> In JavaScript, there are five types of the primitive type: string,
> number, null, undefined, and Boolean. A primitive value is stored
> directly in the stack. These values are stored in the same location
> from which they are accessed. Because of its fixed size, it can be
> easily manipulated.

#### Reference type values

> Reference type values are specialized objects similar to arrays and
> functions stored in a heap. A pointer is used to locate their location
> into the memory.

##### Description

> In JavaScript, a variable holding a reference type value is stored in
> the heap memory. These objects cannot be easily manipulated because
> they contain arbitrary elements and properties. When a reference value
> is passed to a function, the function modifies its values or contents,
> and that change can be seen by the object, which calls the function
> and other functions that have references to the object.
>
> []{#_bookmark365 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*

### The execution context and scope

> The scope and context are not the same things. Every function in
> JavaScript has a scope and a context. When we declare a function in
> JavaScript, this function can be accessed in different and various
> contexts and scopes. JavaScript follows design patterns for scopes and
> context.
>
> The main difference between a scope and context is that scope is
> function based and context is object based. The scope is used to
> access a function when it is invoked.
>
> Whereas the context is used with the this keyword, so it is basically
> a reference type.
>
> The scope is associated with the execution context when the execution
> context starts. There is a chain of scope with it, for example:
>
> function first() { second();
>
> function second() { third();
>
> function third() { fourth();
>
> function fourth() {
>
> // do something
>
> }
>
> }
>
> }
>
> }
>
> first();
>
> In JavaScript, the environment in which the code is executed is
> classified into the
>
> following:

-   Global code

-   Function code

-   Eval code

#### The global code

> The global code is a default environment where the code is executed
> for the first
>
> time, that is, the external .js files and local inline code are
> loaded.

#### The function code

> *Chapter 8*
>
> The function code is the environment in which flow control enters the
> function body during the code execution. Every return from the
> function exits the current execution context.

#### The eval code

> The code is supplied to built-in eval functions. The eval code calls
> the context and creates an execution context.
>
> For example:
>
> var eval_context = { a: 10, b: 20, c: 30 }; function test() {
>
> console.log(this);
>
> }
>
> function evalInContext() {
>
> console.log(this); // { a: 10, b: 20, c: 30 } eval(\"test()\"); // {
> a: 10, b: 20, c: 30 } inside test()
>
> }
>
> evalInContext.call(eval_context);
>
> In this example you call the function with the context you want and
> run eval within that function.

### Garbage collection

> There is no separate memory management in JavaScript. A browser
> decides when a cleanup is needed. Garbage collection is basically
> knowing if the variables are still being used or will be used in
> future throughout the program execution and if not
>
> collect and remove them. In simple words, the track of reference made
> to an object is kept in background. once it becomes idle or reaches
> zero it can be collected by the GC.
>
> We can clean memory manually, but in some cases, there is no need for
> manual memory cleaning. We cannot force JavaScript to clean memory
> because this task is done on runtime by the garbage collector. Some
> heavy applications, such as computer games, require a lot of memory
> and slowdown your system; so, in this
>
> case, it only depends on your code and how you structured your
> application code for use of computer memory.
>
> You can structure your code by following these steps:
>
> []{#_bookmark367 .anchor}*[JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics,
> and Variable Types]{.underline}*

#### Objects

> When you declare an object, try to reuse that object by deleting its
> properties and restoring it to an empty object such as {}. This
> process is known as recycling the objects. When an object is created
> for the first time (new foo();), memory is allocated to it. So, if an
> object is already declared, we can reuse it in our script.

#### Arrays

> When you use an array in your script, clear that array after using it.
> Assigning \[\] to an array is often used as a shorthand to clear it,

# JavaScript Expressions, Operators, Statements,

# and Arrays

> JavaScript is the most commonly used web programming language and is
> very popular among developers around the world. This chapter will
> cover most of the expressions, operators, statements, and arrays used
> in this language.

## Expressions

> A valid unit of code required to resolve a value is known as an
> **expression**. It is a set of literals, operators, variables, and
> expressions required to evaluate a value. This value can be a string
> or any logical value. An expression results in a value that can be
> written wherever a value is expected. There are two types of
> expressions:

-   An expression that assigns a value to a variable

-   An expression that has a value Consider the following example:

> var A = 2;
>
> In the preceding example, a value is assigned to variable A, and for
> assigning that value to the variable, we use an assignment operator.
> Now consider another example:
>
> 2+3;
>
> []{#_bookmark369 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*
>
> In this example, no value is assigned to a variable; however, it
> evaluates the result of
>
> 2+3 as 5. The operator used in this expression is known as an
> **addition operator**.
>
> Expressions in JavaScript can be broadly classified into three types:

-   **Arithmetic**: These evaluate numbers. This means that these
    expressions perform mathematical calculations between values.

-   **Logical**: These are used to evaluate and give the result in the
    form of true or

> false.

-   **String**: These are used to evaluate strings.

> There is another type of expression known as a **conditional
> expression**. These expressions are usually used in the if-else and
> loop conditions. These conditional expressions evaluate the result in
> the form of true or false and have only two values True and False. If
> the first condition is true, then it will evaluate first, otherwise it
> will evaluate second, for example:
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image80.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365748031496063in"}int age = 20; var flag;
>
> if (age\<18) {
>
> flag=true;
>
> }
>
> else {
>
> flag=false;
>
> }

### Primary expressions

> In JavaScript, primary expressions are basic keywords and they are
> special objects, identifiers, and literals, which do not need any
> further evaluation to resolve their value. They may also be the result
> of another expression that is surrounded by brackets.
>
> For example, this and function are keywords and these are primary
> expressions in JavaScript. The this keyword always returns a value
> whenever it enters an execution context. Identifiers are also primary
> expressions, and they refer to a function or an object.

[]{#_bookmark370 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

> There are four types of literals, as primary expressions:

-   **Boolean literals**: These contain 1/0 or true/false

-   **Null literals**: These contain a null value

-   **Undefined literals**: These contain any type of data type

-   **String literals**: These contain a string of characters

### Object initializer

> In JavaScript, an object initializer is used to initialize an object.
> It is an expression known as an **object initializer**. Every object
> in JavaScript is an entity that has a type. Every object has some
> property associated with it. There are functions associated with
> objects and these functions are called **methods**. Objects properties
> are basically JavaScript variables. A property associated with an
> object tells you about the object\'s characteristics.
>
> Object properties can belong to primitive data types such as int or
> other data types such as char. An object can have an empty property as
> well. We can create an object with an empty property, as follows:
>
> var xyz={};
>
> In these curly brackets, you can easily and quickly create objects.
> These are comma- separated name-value pairs. The object initializer is
> basically used to create a new object. These object initializers are
> called **object literals**.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image81.png){width="0.31995188101487315in"
> height="0.39965879265091864in"}In JavaScript, the property name and
> object name are case sensitive, so when you create an object, this
> should be kept in mind.
>
> An object initializer creates an object with a literal notation, for
> example:
>
> var studentInfo = { age:24, Name:\"Ali\" };
>
> This is covered in more detail in *Chapter 8*, *JavaScript
> Object-Oriented Programming*.

### The function definition expression

> Functions in JavaScript are defined with a function keyword.
> Expressions are defined on these functions. They are used to declare a
> function or function expression. You can define a function anywhere in
> your script. Functions use expressions to define their prototype.
>
> There are many ways to define a function in JavaScript, for example,
> we have the
>
> following:

-   The function declaration

-   The function expression

#### The function declaration

> When a browser thinks of executing a script, a function declaration is
> a pre-executed stage. A function can be declared anywhere in your
> code:
>
> function greetings() { alert(\"Happy New Year\");
>
> }
>
> greetings();

#### The function expression

> When a function takes the form of an expression, it is called a
> **function expression**. This expression can be a large expression,
> meaning that the function declaration requires several expressions.
> The function that is assigned with a function expression can be named
> or can be without a name. This is commonly referred to as an anonymous
> function. It is a first-class value, which means that it allows
> passing values in the function as parameters.
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> var abc=function() { return 1;
>
> };
>
> var xyz=function foo() { return 2;
>
> };

[]{#_bookmark372 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

> A function value can also be assigned to another function parameter.
> In this way, a function value is passed to another function parameter
> as a pass-by-value.
>
> var f = function f ( function foo() );
>
> A function in JavaScript is also a regular value. If you do not want
> your variables to be set in the global scope, then put these variables
> into a function. We do this because it\'s not always a good choice to
> set a global variable, as it can be accessed by any function anywhere
> in the program, which may alter the value of the variable and
> overwrite the original value that was supposed to be used. Functions
> are generally written inside brackets because JavaScript allows
> expressions to be all in the same space.

### The property access expression

> In JavaScript, to access a value of an object or value of an array
> element, we use the property access operation. There are two ways of
> writing the property access expression to access values from these
> expressions:

-   Bracket notation

-   Dot notation

#### The bracket notation

> A bracket notation is also known as an array notation. The syntax for
> writing a bracket notation is as follows:
>
> get=abc\[xyz\]; abc\[xyz\]=set;
>
> get = abc \[1\]; // get value at array abc index 1

#### The dot notation

> A dot notation is also known as an object notation. The syntax for
> writing a dot notation is as follows:
>
> document.write (\"hello world\");
>
> []{#_bookmark373 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*

### The invocation expression

> In JavaScript, an invocation expression is used to execute or invoke a
> function or an expression. When a function invocation starts, it first
> evaluates its expression and then its arguments. Here are the two
> targets on an invocation expression:

-   The invocation target

-   The optional argument list

#### Invocation target

> An invocation target followed by an open bracket then a target list
> and then a closing bracket target list must be classified as a method
> or object. There are two types of argument lists:

-   Positional arguments

-   Named arguments

> Positional arguments are expressions and named arguments are
> identifiers. Here is
>
> an example of an invocation expression:
>
> Function.getvalue(5); Math.max(2,3);
>
> Named arguments are the arguments that are passed with its name.

#### The optional argument list

> Variable is assigned a value that is passed as a parameter to the
> function. If the value is not passed, a default value is assigned to
> the variable:
>
> function add(a, b) {
>
> b = typeof b !== \'undefined\' ? b : 0; // if b not defined set it to
> 0
>
> return a+b;
>
> }
>
> add(10); // returns 10

### The object creation expression

> *Chapter 9*
>
> In JavaScript, this expression is used to create an object using the
> constructor method. This method is used to initialize an object\'s
> properties. This method first creates new objects and then initializes
> the objects using object initializer methods in JavaScript.
>
> The constructors that are used to initialize the object do not return
> any value, and this value becomes the value of the object. Consider
> the following example:
>
> New myObj();

### Evaluation expression

> The evaluation expression is used to evaluate a string. This is a
> property of the global object in JavaScript. When it evaluates a
> string, it gives a value as the output.
>
> The Eval() function is used in JavaScript to get a value. In this
> function, we do the following:

-   As the input, we pass one argument

-   If it does not return a value, then it means that there is an error
    in the code, and it will send an exception

> var x = 10;
>
> console.log(eval(\"x \* 5\")); //50
>
> There are two ways you can invoke an eval() function:

-   Direct: Calls a function directly named \'eval\'. Direct eval()
    executes code in its local scope. For example:

> var abc = \'global scope\'; function directEval() {
>
> \'use strict\';
>
> var abc = \'local scope\'; console.log(eval(\'abc\')); // local scope
>
> }

-   Indirect: By calling it through call() function, method of window or
    by storing it with a different name and calling from there, etc.
    Indirect eval() executes code in its global scope. For example:

> var abc = \'global scope\'; function indirectEval() {
>
> \'use strict\';
>
> var abc = \'local scope\';
>
> // eval via call()
>
> []{#_bookmark375 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*
>
> console.log(eval.call(null, \'abc\')); // global scope
> console.log(window.eval(\'abc\')); // global scope console.log((1,
> eval)(\'abc\')); // global scope
>
> // eval with a different name var abceval = eval;
>
> console.log(abceval(\'abc\')); // global scope var obj = { eval: eval
> }; console.log(obj.eval(\'abc\')); // global scope
>
> }

## Operators

> In programming languages, operators are operations to be performed on
> operands. Basically, operators are symbols used to perform various
> operations. Consider the following example:
>
> 9 + 11 = 20
>
> In the preceding example, 9 and 11 are operands and + is the
> additional operator.

### Overview

> Like other languages, in JavaScript, there are several operators to
> perform an operation, such as addition, multiplication, subtraction,
> and so on.
>
> In JavaScript, there are different operators such as:

-   The logical operator

-   The bitwise operator

-   The conditional operator

-   The arithmetic operator

-   The assignment operator

#### Binary operator

> As the name suggests, binary operators require two operands; for
> example:
>
> A + B
>
> Here, A and B are operands and + is the operator to perform addition
> between them.

#### Unary operator

> *Chapter 9*
>
> In programming languages, unary operators have just one operand and
> operator with them, for example:
>
> A++;
>
> This can also be written as:
>
> ++A;
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image82.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.33658683289588803in"}A++ is a post increment operator. It
> will first evaluate A and then increment it; whereas,++A is a
> pre-increment operator. It increments the value of A and then
> evaluates the expression.

#### Ternary operator

> The ternary operators require three operands to perform different
> operations; for example:
>
> \<condition\> ? \<true\>: \<false\>;
>
> In the preceding statement, ? is the ternary operator.

### Arithmetic operators

> In programming languages, arithmetic operators are use to perform
> arithmetic operations on values and variables. The basic arithmetic
> operations are as follows:
>
> • +: Addition

-   -: Subtraction

-   \*: Multiplication

-   /: Division

-   %: Modulus operator

> • ++: Increment operator

-   \--: Decrement operator

> These operators perform operations on numeric operands and return a
> result as a numeric value.
>
> []{#_bookmark377 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*
>
> In JavaScript, operators are the same as those in other programming
> languages; for example, if you want to perform division between
> variables, then you will write the expression as follows:
>
> var a=2; a=(2+a)\*1/a;// a=2
>
> console.log(a); // prints 2
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image83.png){width="0.41784120734908137in"
> height="0.3365824584426947in"}In JavaScript, arithmetic operators are
> the most useful and powerful operators.

#### The + operator

> The + operator performs an addition of two or more numbers.

##### Returns

> The + operator returns the addition of the numbers.

##### Parameter

> The + operator does not have any parameters.

##### Description

> The + operator is used to add two numbers or two variables in which
> numbers are stored.
>
> For example:
>
> var a = 3; var b = 4;
>
> var c = a + b;
>
> Document.Write(\"The value of c is \" + c); Document.Write(3+1);
>
> The output of this will be:
>
> The value of c is 7 4

> height="0.33658683289588803in"}This operator can also be used to
> append or concat two strings; for example:
>
> document.write(\"Apple \"+\"Banana\");
>
> The output will be as follows:
>
> Apple Banana

#### The - operator

> The - operator performs a subtraction between two numbers.

##### Returns

> The result of the - operator returns subtraction between two numbers.

##### Parameter

> The - operator has no parameters.

##### Description

> The - operator is used to subtract two numbers or two variables in
> which numbers are stored.
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> var a = 6; var b = 4;
>
> var c = a - b;
>
> Document.Write(\"The value of c is \" + c); Document.Write(3-1);
>
> The output of this will be as follows:
>
> The value of c is 2 2

#### The \* operator

> The \* operator performs a multiplication between two or more numbers.

##### Returns

> The result of the multiplication between the numbers.
>
> []{#_bookmark379 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*

##### Parameter

> There are no parameters.

##### Description

> This operator is used to multiply two or more numbers or two or more
> variables in which numbers are stored.
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> var a = 3; var b = 4;
>
> var c = a \* b;
>
> Document.Write(\"The value of c is \" + c); Document.Write(3\*1);
>
> The output of this will be as follows:
>
> The value of c is 12 3

#### The / operator

> The / operator performs a division between two numbers.

##### Returns

> The result of the division between the numbers.

##### Parameter

> There are no parameters.

##### Description

> This is also called the **remainder operator**, since the value
> returned is not an absolute value (in that, it retains the sign of the
> first operand, not the second).
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> var a = 5; var b = 2;
>
> var c = a % b;
>
> Document.Write(\"The value of c is \" + c); Document.Write(10%3);

[]{#_bookmark380 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

> The output will be as follows:
>
> The value of c is 1 1

#### The % operator

> The % modulus operator is used to calculate the remainder.

##### Returns

> The result of the multiplication between the numbers.

##### Parameter

> There are no parameters.

##### Description

> This operator is used to multiply two or more numbers or two or more
> variables in which numbers are stored.
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> var a = 3; var b = 4;
>
> var c = a \* b;
>
> Document.Write(\"The value of c is \" + c); Document.Write(3\*1);
>
> The output will be as follows:
>
> The value of c is 12 3

#### The ++ Operator

> The ++ operator is used to increment a value.

##### Returns

> The result is the incremented value.

##### Parameter

> There are no parameters.
>
> []{#_bookmark381 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*

##### Description

> Increment. the value and stores the value in itself. Consider the
> following example:
>
> I = 0; // I contains 0
>
> I++; // this line is equivalent to I = I + 1
>
> The output of this will be:
>
> I = 1

#### The \-- Operator

> The \-- operator is used to decrement a value.

##### Returns

> The result is the decremented value.

##### Parameter

> There are no parameters.

##### Description

> The \-- operator decrements the value and stores the value in itself.
> For example:
>
> I = 0; // I contains 0
>
> I\--; // this line is equivalent to I = I - 1
>
> The output will be as follows:
>
> I = - 1

### Logical operators

> In programming languages, logical operators are Boolean operators.
> These operators work on Boolean logic. Like other languages,
> JavaScript works on Boolean evaluation. These Boolean operators always
> return a Boolean value. There are two possible results of any logical
> operator:

-   True

-   False

[]{#_bookmark382 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

> The following are the logical operators used in programming languages
> as well as JavaScript:

-   Logical AND (&&)

-   Logical OR(\|\|)

-   Logical NOT(!)

> ![](./images-ref/media/image85.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.33658683289588803in"} Arithmetic operators get priority over
> logical operators.
>
> Let\'s say, if there is an expression and there are logical and
> arithmetic operators in it, then the arithmetic operators will be
> evaluated first because of their higher priority. Logical operators
> work from left to right.
>
> Logical operations are applicable on everything. A non-Boolean value
> can result in a Boolean value after evaluation.

#### The && Operator

> The && operator is the translation of the English word \"and\". For
> example, if we have to write apples and oranges, we write *apples &&
> oranges*.

##### Returns

> This returns the most specific value on an operand; if a non-Boolean
> value is used, then a non-Boolean value is returned.

##### Parameter

> We normally write an expression or a condition that is to be evaluated
> separated by the \'&&\' sign.

##### Description

> This is called the **AND** operator.
>
> Here is an example of the && operator:
>
> var a= true && true; // it will be true var b=true && false;//it will
> be false

#### The \|\| Operator

> This operator is the translation of the English word \"or\". For
> example, if we have to write apples or oranges, we write *apples \|\|
> oranges*.
>
> []{#_bookmark383 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*

##### Returns

> This returns the most specific value on an operand; if a non-Boolean
> value is used,
>
> then a non-Boolean value is returned.

##### Parameter

> We normally write an expression or a condition that is to be evaluated
> separated by the \'\|\|\' sign.

##### Description

> This is called the **OR** operator.
>
> Here is an example of the \|\| operator:
>
> var a= true \|\| true; // it will be true var b=true \|\| false;// it
> will be true

#### The ! Operator

> This is the NOT operator. NOT operator evaluates if the values are not
> equal to each other. For instance:
>
> if(abc != 0){
>
> //if abc is not equal to 0 run this block
>
> }else{
>
> //if abc = 0 then run this block
>
> }

##### Returns

> Boolean value.

##### Parameter

> null

##### Description

> This is called as the **NOT** operator. Here is an example of the !
> operator:
>
> var a=!false //it will print true var b=!true //it will print false

[]{#_bookmark384 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

> ![](./images-ref/media/image86.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365780839895013in"}In JavaScript, these logical operators
> are used in conditional statements and in the while loop.

### Assignment operators

> In JavaScript, assignment operators are used to assign values to
> variables. The assignment operator = assigns the value of the operand
> on it right to the operand on its left. For instance, abc = xyz, here
> xyz is right operand whose value is being assigned to abc, which is
> the left operand. An assignment operator can assign the value of a
> single variable to multiple variables. In the following sections, we
> will discuss the assignment operators in JavaScript.

#### The = operator

> The = operator is used to assign the value to a variable.

##### Returns

> There are no parameters but it is used between two or more operands.

##### Parameters

> There are no parameters.

##### Description

> This is the simplest of all assignment operators and is used commonly.
> It assigns the value of the right side operand to the left side
> operand.
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> var x=2;
>
> console.log(\"The value of x is \" + x);
>
> The output of this will be:
>
> The value of x is 2

#### The += operator

> This operator is known as addition assignment operator.

##### Returns

> This adds the value to the variable and returns the result of the
> addition.
>
> []{#_bookmark385 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*

##### Parameters

> There are no parameters.

##### Description

> The addition assignment operator is used to add a value to a variable
> and assign the value to another or the same variable in the same
> operation.
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> var abc = 2; abc += 10;
>
> console.log(abc); //12
>
> This is short hand of writing abc = abc + 10.

#### The -= operator

> This operator is known as subtraction assignment operator.

##### Returns

> This operator subtracts the given value from the variable and returns
> the result of the subtraction.

##### Parameters

> There are no parameters.

##### Description

> The -= operator is used to subtract a value from a variable and assign
> the given value to another or the same variable in the same operation.
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> var abc = 10; abc -= 2;
>
> console.log(abc); //8
>
> This is short hand of writing abc = abc - 2.

#### The \*= Operator

> This operator is known as multiplication assignment operator.

##### Returns

> *Chapter 9*
>
> This multiplies the variable and the value and returns the result of
> the multiplication.

##### Parameters

> There are no parameters.

##### Description

> This operator is used to multiply a value with a variable and assign
> the value to another or the same variable in the same operation.
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> var abc = 5; abc \*= 5;
>
> console.log(abc); //25
>
> This is short hand of writing abc = abc \* 5.

#### The /= Operator

> This operator is known as division assignment operator.

##### Returns

> It divides the variable with the value of right operand and assign it
> to the variable.

##### Parameters

> There are no parameters.

##### Description

> This operator is used to divide a variable with the value and assign
> the result to the variable.
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> var abc = 5; abc /= 5;
>
> console.log(abc); //1
>
> This is short hand of writing abc = abc / 5.

#### The %= Operator

> The %= operator is also called remainder assignment operator.
>
> []{#_bookmark387 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*

##### Parameters

> The %= operator takes a null parameter.

##### Returns

> The %= operator returns the remainder.

##### Description

> It divides the variable with the value of right operand and assigns
> the remainder value it to the variable. For example:
>
> var abc = 10; abc %= 3;
>
> console.log(abc); //1
>
> This is short hand of writing abc = abc % 3.

> part of the ECMAScript 2016 (ES7) proposal.

### Exponentiation assignment (\*\*=)

> This operator returns the result of raising power of left operand to
> the value of second operand.
>
> var abc = 5; abc \*\*= 2;
>
> console.log(abc); //25
>
> This is short hand of writing abc = abc \*\* 2.

### Relational operators

> In programming languages, relational operators are also known as
> comparison operators. These operators show the relative order of two
> values. These comparison operators are covered in the following
> sections.

#### The \< operator

> The \< (Less Than) operator operator is used to compare the values on
> both sides of the expression and check whether the value of the
> left-hand side is less than the value on the right-hand side of the
> operator.

[]{#_bookmark388 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

##### Returns

> If the preceding condition is true, then expression returns true else
> false.

##### Parameter

> Here, both the operands must be numbers or both must be strings.

##### Description

> This is also known as the **less than** operator.
>
> A simple example of the usage of this operator is as follows:
>
> if(2\<3) { //returns true
>
> //block of code
>
> }

#### The \<= Operator

> The \<= operator is used to compare the values on both sides of the
> expression
>
> and check whether the value on the left-hand side is less than or
> equal to the value on the right-hand side of the operator.

##### Returns

> If the preceding condition is true, then it returns the Boolean value
> true, otherwise it returns false.

##### Parameter

> Here, both the operands must be numbers or both must be strings.

##### Description

> This is also known as the **less than or equal to** operator. A simple
> example of the usage of this is as follows:
>
> if(2 \<= 3) { //returns true
>
> //block of code

## Statements {#statements-2}

> JavaScript works on sets of statements. These statements have an
> appropriate syntax where the syntax depends on what the statements
> contain. A statement can have multiple lines in it. Basically, a
> statement is a set of instructions given to a computer browser to
> execute JavaScript code. A statement can return a value that is
> terminated with a semicolon. A statement can be a call for a certain
> action, for example:
>
> Document.Write(\"hello world\");
>
> The preceding statement calls the in-built Write() function and prints
> the message
>
> **hello world** on the screen.
>
> We can write multiple statements in one line separated by a semicolon;
> for example:
>
> var a=20; var b=2;var c=a\*b; document.write(c);

[]{#_bookmark392 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

> A statement can also be terminated with a line break, for example:
>
> var a=20;
>
> Document.Write(a);
>
> Each statement in JavaScript runs one by one in order of the given
> instructions in the JavaScript program.

### Expression statements

> In JavaScript, there is a difference between a statement and an
> expression. Whenever a value is expected in your script or code, an
> expression produces that value using a statement.
>
> An expression is made of literals, variables, operators, and methods.
> The data type of the returned value depends on the variable used in
> the expression. We can create a compound expression from a smaller
> expression\'s group depending on their data type.
>
> x = Math.PI;
>
> cx = Math.cos(x);
>
> alert(\"cos(\" + x + \") = \" + cx);
>
> Statements are basically actions performed in scripts, for example,
> loops and
>
> if-else are statements in JavaScript. Wherever JavaScript expects a
> statement and you can also write an expression, is called an
> expression statement. It fulfills purpose of both statement and
> expression. But this can not be reversed. We can not write a statement
> where JavaScript is expecting an expression. For instance, if
> statement can not be used as an argument to a function.
>
> To prevent this from happening JavaScript doesn\'t allow us to use
> function expressions and object literals as statements, that is,
> **expression statement** should not start with:

-   Curly brace

-   Keyword function

### Compound empty statements

> A compound statement is a set of statements written in curly brackets
> and all these statements are separated by a semicolon. It combines
> multiple statements in a program into a single statement. A compound
> statement is also known as a **block statement**.
>
> []{#_bookmark393 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*
>
> This type of statement is usually used with conditional statements
> such as if, else, for, while loop, and so on. Consider the following
> example:
>
> if(x\<10) // if x is less than 10 then x is incremented { x++;
>
> }
>
> An empty statement is the opposite of a compound statement. There is
> no statement in an empty statement but just a semicolon. This
> semicolon means that no statement will be executed. Usually, empty
> statements are used when you need to put comments in your code.
> Consider the following example:
>
> for(i=0; i\<10; i++)
>
> {} /\* Empty \*/

### Declaration statements

> This statement is use to declare a variable or a function in
> JavaScript.

#### function

> In JavaScript, the function keyword is used to declare a function in a
> program. Here is a simple example where the myFunction function is
> declared:
>
> function myFunction() {
>
> //block of code
>
> }

#### var {#var-2}

> In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. We need
> to declare a variable before using it.
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> var a =5;
>
> var b = 23.5;
>
> var c = \"Good morning\";
>
> Here is an example of both var and function:
>
> var a=2; var b=3;
>
> function Addition(x,y) { return x+y;

[]{#_bookmark394 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

> }
>
> var c= Addition(a,b)
>
> Document.Write(\"The value of c is \" + c)
>
> The output of the preceding code will be as follows:
>
> The value of c is 5

### Conditional statements

> In JavaScript, when we want to perform different actions for different
> statements, we use a conditional statement. These are a set of
> commands to perform different actions on different conditions. In
> JavaScript, there are three types of conditional statements, which are
> as follows:

-   if

-   else

-   switch

> Basically, these statements show the flow of your code. Conditional
> statements control the flow of your program, that is, which action
> will be perform on which condition.
>
> Consider an example where you have an e-commerce website and you want
> to display an offer label on a product when there is special offer on
> it. In such a scenario, you can place the appropriate code inside
> conditional statements.

#### If statements

> In programming languages, the if statement is a control statement. An
> if statement has two important parts:

-   A condition

-   A code to perform the action

> In JavaScript and other languages, the if statement makes decisions
> based on the variable and type of data. For example, if you write a
> script asking to be notified on your birthday, then when the time
> arrives, the message \"**It\'s your birthday today**\" will be
> displayed.
>
> The if statement is only executed when the condition is true. If the
> expression is
>
> false, then it will not execute.
>
> []{#_bookmark395 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*

##### Syntax

> Here is the syntax for an if statement in JavaScript:
>
> if(condition) {
>
> // block of code
>
> }

##### Example

> For example, in JavaScript, we can write an if statement code as
> follows:
>
> var cAge=25;
>
> If (cAge\>18) {
>
> document.write (\"You must have CNIC\");
>
> }// if age is above 18 it displays that you must have a CNIC

#### Else if statements

> In JavaScript, there may be some situations when we require to make a
> decision based on different possibilities. The else if statement will
> only be executed when the previous statement is false and its
> condition is true. There are two major points of the else if
> statement, they are as follows:

-   There should be an if statement before any else if statement

-   You may use as many else if statements as desired, but at the end,
    you must have an else statement.

##### Syntax

> Here is the syntax for a simple if statement in JavaScript:
>
> if(condition 1) {
>
> // block of code
>
> }
>
> else if(condition 2) {
>
> //block of code
>
> }
>
> else {
>
> // block of code
>
> }
>
> In the preceding syntax, two conditions can be checked for their
> validity.

[]{#_bookmark396 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

> Here is the syntax for a slightly more complex else if statement in
> JavaScript:
>
> if(condition 1) {
>
> // block of code
>
> }
>
> else if(condition 2) {
>
> // block of code
>
> }
>
> else if(condition 3) {
>
> // block of code
>
> }
>
> else {
>
> // block of code
>
> }
>
> In the preceding syntax, three conditions can be checked for their
> validity.

##### Example

> For example, if you have a web page and you want to check who is
> accessing that web page. You will put two custom messages in your
> script inside the Else if statement. You will write these as follows:
>
> var person=\"Manager\"; If(person==\"Admin\") {
>
> Document.Write(\"I am visiting it\");
>
> }
>
> Else if(person==\"Manager\") { Document.Write(\"I am accessing it\");
>
> }
>
> Else {
>
> document.write(\"hello kitty\");
>
> }
>
> The Else if statement is one of the most advanced forms of statements
> in JavaScript. It makes a decision after checking all the if
> conditions. It is just a type of complex statement where every if is a
> part of an else statement. All conditions must be true within the
> parenthesis following the else if keyword. If any of the conditions
> are false, then the else part will be executed.
>
> []{#_bookmark397 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*

#### Switch statement

> In programming languages, the switch statement execution depends only
> on the value of the expression. There are lists of cases against which
> checks are done. The checks are done sequentially; JavaScript
> interpreter checks the first case and its condition to check whether
> it is true or not. Similarly, checks are done for all case statements
> to check whether their conditions are true and to find a break
> statement. When the interpreter encounters the break statement, it
> exits the switch loop. The break statement is meant to ensure that the
> switch statement returns control to the calling function once one case
> is executed, interpreter does not forward the control to the next
> applicable case.

##### Syntax

> Here is the syntax for a simple switch statement in JavaScript:
>
> switch(condition/expression) case expression 1:
>
> //block of code break;
>
> case expression 2:
>
> //block of code break;
>
> case expression 3:
>
> //block of code break;
>
> default:
>
> //block of code break;

##### Example

> Following is an example of a valid switch statement:
>
> Switch (personName) case \"Jack\":
>
> alert(\"my name is Jack\"); Break;
>
> case \"Ahmed\":
>
> alert(\"my name is Ahmed\"); break;
>
> default:
>
> alert(\"my name is Talha\"); break;

[]{#_bookmark398 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

> If the preceding code does not find a matching case then it executes
> the default statement. Basically a switch statement is an expression
> which evaluates different statements in order to execute some code
> based on some conditions.

### Loops

> In programming languages, loops are used to execute a block of code a
> number of times, depending on a condition. For example, if you have a
> statement and you want to execute it over and over, you just put it in
> a loop. Loops are basically used for repetitive tasks.
>
> Another specific example of a loop is that if you want to traverse an
> array to find a specific number, you have to iterate through array
> elements. Each iteration will get the next array index.
>
> There are four types of loops in JavaScript, they are as follows:

-   for

-   while

-   do-WHILE

-   for-in

> For repetitive tasks we put a set of instructions in a loop. To
> control the number of times a loop executes, we use control variables
> in a loop for incrementing or
>
> decrementing value of an iterator or counter variable, which will
> repeat the block of code. You can also use the break and continuous
> statements in a loop.

#### For loop

> The for loops are used to loop through or execute a block of code,
> until a condition returns a false result. In a for loop, we mention
> how many times the script should perform. For example, you might want
> to execute your script 12 times.

##### Syntax

> A for loop in JavaScript is the same as in other languages, such as C,
> C++, and Python. The for loop syntax has three important parts:

-   **Initialization**: This is where loop initializes the counter
    variable. This is the first statement when a loop starts its
    execution.

-   **Condition**: This is an expression to be evaluated before every
    loop iteration. If the condition is satisfied and is true, we enter
    the loop; otherwise, if the condition is not satisfied and the
    condition returns false, then we exit the for loop.

> []{#_bookmark399 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*

-   **Increment/Decrement**: This is used for iteration and for
    increasing or decreasing the counter variable value. This is an
    update statement where increment or decrement is executed.

> for (initialization; condition; increment / decrement) {
>
> //code block
>
> }

##### Example

> Consider the following example of a basic counter code in JavaScript:
>
> var i; // declares the variable i for(i=1; i \< 5 ; i++) {
>
> Document.Write(\"basic counter:\"+i); Document.Write(\"\<br/\>\");
>
> }
>
> The output will be as follows:
>
> Basic counter:1 Basic counter:2 Basic counter:3 Basic counter:4

#### While loop

> This is also a commonly used loop in JavaScript. The while loop
> executes a block of statements repeatedly as long as its condition is
> true. The loop exits when the condition becomes false.

##### Syntax

> Here is the syntax for a while loop in JavaScript:
>
> while (condition expression) {
>
> // code block
>
> }
>
> There are two parts of a while loop:

-   The condition statement

-   The while loop code written in curly brackets

> The while loop conditions have to be met in order for the loop to
> work. If the condition breaks, then the loop breaks.

[]{#_bookmark400 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

##### Example

> Here is an example of the while loop, which will print numbers from 1
> to 4:
>
> var count= 0; While(count\<5) {
>
> Document.Write(\"count\"); Document.Write(\"\<br/\>\"); count++;
>
> }
>
> The output will be as follows:
>
> 1
>
> 2
>
> 3
>
> 4

#### Do while loop

> The do while loop is also known as a **post-test loop** because it
> first executes the statement and then checks the condition. If the
> condition is true, then it will enter the loop, and if the condition
> is false, it will break out from the loop.

##### Syntax

> Here is the syntax for the do while loop in JavaScript:
>
> Do {
>
> //statement
>
> }
>
> While(condition);
>
> There are two important parts of the do while loop:

-   A statement

-   A condition

> The do while loop is similar to the while loop, but it checks the
> condition at the end of the loop. The do while loop executes the
> specified statement at least once before checking the condition.
>
> []{#_bookmark401 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*

##### Example

> Here is an example of the do while loop that prints the values 1 to 5:
>
> var i=1;
>
> Do {
>
> document.write(\"The value of i is \" + i + \"\</br\>\"); i++;
>
> }
>
> While(i\<6);
>
> The output will be as follows:
>
> The value of i is 1 The value of i is 2 The value of i is 3 The value
> of i is 4 The value of i is 5
>

> height="0.39963692038495185in"}The do while loop can be used where we
> need to execute the loop at least once, irrespective of whether or not
> the condition is met.

#### For in loop

> There is another type on loop used in JavaScript that is known as the
> for in loop. This loop is used for object properties in JavaScript. In
> this loop, one property of the object is assigned to a variable name.

##### Syntax

> Here is a syntax for the for in loop in JavaScript:
>
> For (property in object) {
>
> //code block
>
> }

##### Example

> Here is an example of the for in loop:
>
> var I;
>
> For (I is navigator) { Document.Write(i);
>
> }
>
> Document.Write(\"The loop ends here\");

### Jumps and labeled statements

> *Chapter 9*
>
> In JavaScript, the jump statements are used to force the flow of
> execution to jump to another condition in the script. Basically, it is
> used to terminate iterative statements. There are two types of jump
> statements in JavaScript:

-   Break

-   Continue

> These statements are used when you immediately leave a loop or when
> you want to jump to another condition due to a condition in a code.

#### Break statement

> In JavaScript, a break statement is used with a switch statement. It
> is used to exit a loop or a condition earlier than planned. Break
> statements are also used in the for loop and the while loop.

##### Syntax

> Here is the syntax for the break statement in JavaScript:
>
> Any loop(condition) {
>
> //block of code that will be executed break;
>
> //block of code that won\'t get executed
>
> }

##### Example

> Consider the following simple example:
>
> var i=1;
>
> While(i\<10) {
>
> if(i==3) {
>
> Document.Write(\"Breaking from if loop\"); Break;
>
> }
>
> Document.Write(\"The value of i is \" + i); i+=2;
>
> }
>
> The output will be as follows:
>
> The value of i is 1 Breaking from if loop The value of i is 3
>
> []{#_bookmark403 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*

#### Continue statement

> The keyword continue will skip the current iteration.

##### Syntax

> Here is the syntax for the continue statement in JavaScript:
>
> Any loop(condition) {
>
> //block of code that will be executed Any loop (condition) {
>
> //block of code that will be executed continue;
>
> block of code that wont be executed
>
> }
>
> //block of code that will be executed
>
> }

##### Example

> Consider the following simple example:
>
> var i=1;
>
> While(i\<5) {
>
> if(i==3) //skip the iteration { Document.Write(\"Continue statement
> encountered\"); continue;
>
> }
>
> Document.Write(\"The value of i is \" + i); i=i+2;
>
> }
>
> The output will be as follows:
>
> The value of i is 1
>
> Continue statement encountered

#### Return statement

> In JavaScript, a return statement is used to return a value from a
> function. After returning the value, it stops the function execution.
> Every function and statement returns a value. If no return statement
> is provided, undefined value is returned instead.

[]{#_bookmark404 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

##### Syntax

> Here is the syntax for the return statement in JavaScript:
>
> function myfunc(x, y) {
>
> //some block of code return x;
>
> }
>
> Document.Write(\"The result is \" + myfunc(2, 3));

##### Example

> Consider the following simple example showing the working of a return
> statement:
>
> Function multiply(a,b) { return a\*B;
>
> }
>
> var mul=multiply(2,3); Document.Write(\"The result is \"+ mul);
>
> The output will be as follows:
>
> The result is 6

#### Throw statement

> A throw statement is used to create a user-defined error condition for
> the try and catch block. These errors are also called **exceptions**.
> We can create our own exceptions in a code script.

##### Syntax

> Here is the syntax for the throw statement in JavaScript:
>
> try {
>
> //block of code throw \"error\";
>
> //block of code
>
> }
>
> catch(error) {
>
> //block of code
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark405 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*

##### Example

> Let\'s take a look at the following code snippet:
>
> Try {
>
> document.write( \"hello world);//the code will throw an error due to
> the missing \"
>
> }
>
> Catch(error) { Error.messageTxt;
>
> }

#### Try catch finally statement

> In a try statement we write the code that needs error testing when it
> is being executed. In a catch block, you write code to handle errors
> occurring in the try block. When you write code inside the try block,
> you must write a catch block to handle any error that might occur in
> the the try block. The finally statement executes when the try and
> catch statements are executed successfully.

##### Syntax

> The syntax for a try, catch, and finally block is as shown in the
> following code snippet:
>
> Try {//generate exception} Catch {//error handling code}
>
> Finally {//block of code which runs after try and catch}

## Arrays

> Arrays are use to store ordered collections of data. If we have
> multiple items, then we can use arrays to store these values. Array
> prototype methods are used to perform mutation operations in
> JavaScript. There is no fixed length of an array. An array can contain
> multiple value types and the number of items can be mutated at any
> point after initialization.

### Array types

> There are two array types in JavaScript:

-   **Nominal type**: This type of array has a unique identity.

-   **Structure type**: This array type looks like an interface; it is
    also known as duck type. It uses a specific implementation of a
    behavior.

[]{#_bookmark406 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

> **Sparse array**
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image89.png){width="0.4178423009623797in"
> height="0.336576990376203in"}In programming languages, a sparse array
> denotes an array that has the same values such as 0 or null. There is
> a large number of zeroes in an array storage, which occurs in a sparse
> array. In a sparse array, indexes do not start from 0. In a sparse
> array, lengths of the elements are less than the length of the
> property.
>
> In JavaScript, the length property is not the actual amount of
> elements in the array, it is last *index+1*. So, in case of a sparse
> array, this is crucial to deal with the blank indexes. Consider the
> following example:
>
> var person=\[\]; Person\[1\]=\"Ali\"; Person\[20\]=\"Ahmed\";
>
> Alert(person.length);// it will be 21 length

### Array type object

> Some objects in JavaScript look like an array, but in reality, they
> are not arrays. They are known as **array-like** objects.
>
> An array-like object:

-   **Has**: This tells you the number of elements an object has

-   **Does not have**: These are array methods such as indexOf, push,
    and forEach

> **Strings as an array**
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image90.png){width="0.41784120734908137in"
> height="0.3365824584426947in"}There are some strings in JavaScript
> that behave like an array. If we make a string like an array, then it
> will only be treated as an array. There are some methods in arrays
> such as push(), reverse(), and so on, which do not work on strings.

### Creating arrays

> In JavaScript, there are two ways to create arrays:

-   Using an array initializer

-   Using an array constructor

> You can use either of these two methods.
>
> []{#_bookmark407 .anchor}*[JavaScript Expressions, Operators,
> Statements, and Arrays]{.underline}*
>
> We have a comma-separated string in brackets in an array initializer;
> for example:
>
> var students= \[\"Ali\",\"Ahmed\",\"Amina\"\];
>
> In JavaScript, you can also create an array using an array constructor
> using a new keyword, which creates an array and assigns values to it;
> for example:
>
> var students=new Array (\"Ali,\"Ahmed\",\"Amina\");
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image91.png){width="0.3199475065616798in"
> height="0.39965332458442693in"}The array initializer method is a quick
> and good way of initializing an array because its execution speed is
> higher than that of the constructor method. If you do not pass any
> argument in an array constructor, then it will set its length to zero.

#### Array initializer

> Arrays are used to store ordered collections of data in a single
> variable. It means that when you want to store a list of items then
> you should use an array. Before using
>
> an array in your program you need to first initialize it.
>
> In an array initializer, there are comma separated lists of items
> stored in a variable, for example:
>
> var a1=\[\]; var a2=\[2\];
>
> var a3=\[1,2,3\];
>

> array initializer, the type does not have to be the same for all
> items. Also, arrays can have zero length.

#### Array constructor

> There are three different ways in which you can use an array
> constructor. Their syntax is as follows:
>
> var a1=new array(); // new empty array
>
> var a2=new array(2); // new array of size 2
>
> var a3= new array(1,2,3); // new array containing 1, 2, 3
>
> If you call an array constructor without argument it will set its
> length to zero.
>
> If an array constructor has only one argument then this argument will
> initialize its new length.

[]{#_bookmark408 .anchor}*Chapter 9*

> If you call an array with two or more elements, the the argument will
> initialize an array with size equal to the number of parameters.

### Reading and writing array elements

> To read and write elements from an array we use square brackets \[\].
> It works as accessing object properties. Inside the brackets there
> should be a non-negative number. The syntax for both reading and
> writing in an array is the same. Values are also indexed in an array.
> You read values index by index. The array\'s reference should be on
> left side of bracket.
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> var obj=\[\"abc\"\];
>
> var start=obj\[0\]; //its is for reading Document.Write(start);
>
> var obj\[1\]=\"hello\"; i=\"world\";
>
> Obj\[i\]=\"hello world\";//writing Document.Write(obj\[i\]);
>
> The output of this would be as follows:
>
> Hello world

### Multidimensional arrays in JavaScript

> Like other programming languages, you can also create multidimensional
> arrays in JavaScript. Their syntax is same as in other languages. In
> multidimensional arrays you create arrays within arrays of nested
> array loops.
>
> You can create an array by adding more arrays for each dimension you
> need. Creating a multidimensional array is useful when you need to
> cover the whole storage with information. If most of your data is
> sparse, meaning if array is empty, then a better technique to store
> the information is using an associative array. Here is an example of
> creating a multidimensional array in JavaScript:
>
> var a=5; var b=2;
>
> var c=new array();
>
> For(i=0;i\<5;i++) {
>
> C\[i\]=new array(); for For(j=0;j\<5;j++) c\[i\]\[j\]; }}
>
> }
>

### Properties in an array

> An array has a prototype, length, and a constructor as its properties.

#### Length

> In JavaScript, the array length property returns the number of
> elements in an array.

##### Returns

> This returns an integer value of 32 bit.

##### Description

> We can also use an array length property when we want to empty an
> array at any time. When you increase the length of any array, it will
> not increase the number of elements in it. We can set or return the
> length of any array using the array length property.
>
> Consider the following example:
>
> var num=new Array\[1,2,3\]; Document. write (num.length);
>
> The output will be as follows:
>
> 3

#### Constructor

> An array contractor is used to initialize an array. An array can
> contain zero or more elements and has the following syntax where array
> elements are separated by a comma inside square brackets.
>
> var fruits = \[\"Apple\", \"Banana\"\];

#### Prototype

> All array instances inherit from Array.prototype. The prototype
> constructor of an array allows to add new methods and properties to
> the Array() object.
>
> Array.prototype is an array itself. Array.isArray(Array.prototype); //
> true
>
> You can find detailed information on how to make these changes at MDN
> ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype)
> [Global_Objects/Array/prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype)).

### ECMA5 Array methods

> New array methods were added into the ECMA5 script, which is also
> known as **arrays extras**. These are nine new methods. These methods

> It loops through an array, running a function, and creates a new array
> based on the return values from each iteration. It takes the same
> arguments as the forEach() method.
>
> Here is a simple example:
>
> var numbers = \[1, 4, 9\];
>
> var roots = numbers.map(Math.sqrt);
>

# JavaScript Object-Oriented

Programming

> JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language. In
> **object-oriented programming** (**OOP**) languages, we use the
> concept of objects rather than actions to develop applications. In the
> past, JavaScript had no real foundation and was just a basic language.
> JavaScript is not a fully OOP-based language like JAVA, C#, and other
> programming languages, but it still has many OOP features.
>
> There are many features in JavaScript where code is reused. So, rather
> than using procedural concepts in JavaScript, we use object-oriented
> programming techniques. There are four basic principles of
> object-oriented programming.

## Polymorphism

> Since JavaScript is a dynamic language, it supports **polymorphism**.
> Polymorphism can be understood as the ability of an object to be
> different at different times. For example, a shape can be a square, a
> rectangle, or a circle.

### Encapsulation

> This feature is also supported in JavaScript. It means protecting
> parts of code from external use. It protects part of the code that
> does not concern the end user but is important for running an
> application, such as in an application that stores passwords. Users
> don\'t have to know how their passwords are encrypted. Hence, this
> code is encapsulated.
>
> []{#_bookmark423 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

### Inheritance

> In JavaScript, inheritance can be used to derive properties of parent
> objects to their child objects and have some unique attributes for
> themselves as well. For example, a square and a triangle may inherit
> their stroke or fill from a shape object and, at the same time, have a
> number of vertices unique to themselves.

### Abstraction

> Abstraction is not natively supported in JavaScript, but there are
> methods through which this can be achieved, using a combination of
> polymorphism and inheritance.

## Objects

> Objects are the basic key to understand object-oriented programming.
> Programming objects are just like real-world objects. Look around,
> you\'ll see many objects. Your car, mobile phone, desk, laptop, pet
> dog, and DVD player are all objects.
>
> All objects have two characteristics: properties and methods.
>
> A mobile has properties (color, screen size, height, and weight) and
> methods (make
>
> calls, send SMSs, receive calls, and transfer files).
>
> A car has properties (color, height, gearbox, wheels, engine, brakes,
> and steering) and methods (start engine, steer, change gear, apply
> brake, stop, and crash).
>
> Just like these real-world examples, the objects in OOP have the same
> characteristics. So, an object, in terms of programming, can have
> properties (variables in any programming language) and methods
> (functions in any programming language).
>
> Hence, we can define an object as \"*an entity or a thing that has
> some properties and methods associated with it. An object can be
> individually selected and manipulated*\".
>
> All generic properties and methods are combined into a template called
> a **class**. A class is then used as a template to instantiate single
> or multiple objects.
>
> In JavaScript, there are many built-in objects, such as Maths, Dates,
> Regular Expressions, Arrays, and so on.

[]{#_bookmark424 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

### Creating objects

> In JavaScript, we can create objects in three different ways:

-   Using object literals

-   Using new keywords

-   Using the object.create() method (ECMAScript 5)

#### Object literals

> This is the simplest way to create an object. An object can be both
> created and defined in one statement using an object literal. An
> object literal is a comma- separated list of name:value (like
> year:1990, age:25) pairs enclosed within curly brackets.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> var car= { model:\"2014\", company:\"Honda\", color:\"White\"
>
> };
>
> In the preceding example, we have created a car object with four
> properties or attributes.
>
> var empty = {}
>
> On the other hand, this piece of code creates an object with no
> properties.

#### The new keyword

> The new keyword is used to create and initialize a new object. The new
> keyword is always followed by a function call. This function is known
> as a constructor, which initializes the newly created object.
> JavaScript contains built-in constructors for the native types.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> var car = new Object(); car.model = \"2014\"; car.company = \"Honda\";
> car.colour = \"White\";
>
> []{#_bookmark425 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*
>
> The preceding example also creates a new car object with four
> properties:
>
> varempty = new Object(); // An empty object, same as {}. vararr = new
> Array(); // An empty array, same as \[\]. varcurrdate = new Date(); //
> Current Date.
>
> varregex = new RegExp(\"JavaScript\"); // A pattern matching object.

#### The object.create() method

> The object.create() method was originally defined in ECMAScript 5. It
> is also used to create an object. The first argument passed to this
> method is the prototype of that object. The second argument is
> optional. It describes the object\'s properties.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> // obj1 inherits properties model, company and colour. varcar =
>
> Object.create({model:\"2014\",company:\"Honda\",colour:\"White\"});
>
> // car inherits no properties or methods. varcar =
> Object.create(null);
>
> Null can be passed if the object does not have any prototype. However,
> this object will not inherit anything:
>
> // car is same as {} or new Object(). varcar =
> Object.create(Object.prototype);

### Design patterns

> To write scalable code, we need to track down the recurring sections
> in our code and to optimize them in a way that it\'s easy to maintain
> the code. Design patterns help us in doing this.
>
> In a book, *Addison-Wesley Professional* by *Erich Gamma*, *John
> Vlissides*, *Ralph Johnson*, and *Richard Helm*; First edition
> (November 10, 1994), Design Patterns are defined as:
>
> *A design pattern names, abstracts, and identifies the key aspects of
> a common design structure that make it useful for creating a reusable
> object-oriented design. The design pattern identifies the
> participating classes and their instances, their roles and
> collaborations, and the distribution of responsibilities.*
>
> []{#_bookmark426 .anchor}*Each design pattern focuses on a particular
> object-oriented design problem or*
>
> *Chapter 10*
>
> *issue. It describes when it applies, whether or not it can be applied
> in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and
> trade-offs of its use. Since we must eventually implement our designs,
> a design pattern also provides sample code to illustrate an
> implementation.*
>
> *Although design patterns describe object-oriented designs, they are
> based on practical solutions that have been implemented in mainstream
> object-oriented programming languages.*
>
> Developers usually question whether there is any best design pattern
> to implement
>
> in their workflow.
>
> Actually, no single design pattern is perfect for all scenarios. Each
> and every web application that is developed has its own needs. We have
> to see which pattern will add value to our application if implemented,
> because all design patterns serve different solutions.
>
> So, once we have a good understanding of design patterns, it will be
> easier for us to integrate a pattern into our application
> architecture. Design patterns are classified into three categories:
> creational, structural, and behavioral.

-   **Creational design patterns**: Constructor, factory, prototype, and
    singleton are examples of creational design patterns

-   **Structural design patterns**: Decorator, façade, and flyweight are
    example of structural design patterns

-   **Behavioral design patterns**: Observer and mediator are examples
    of such patterns

#### Constructor pattern

> Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects. They may
> accept arguments, which are then used to set values to member
> properties and methods when the object is created. Native
> constructors, such as arrays and objects, are present inside
> JavaScript as native functions. We can also create custom constructors
> that define properties and methods for our custom object.
>
> []{#_bookmark427 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

##### Description

> In the constructor method, we create an object using the new keyword.
> In this method, we define properties and methods with the this
> keyword. Properties are defined after the = sign. When you define each
> property, you must place a semicolon at the end. When you use the this
> method in your script, you need to first initialize the object and
> then use it in your code:

###### Simple constructors

> A constructor is considered to be the most suitable way to implement
> an instance. The new keyword tells JavaScript that we would like that
> function to act like a constructor and to create an instance also
> called object. Within a constructor, the this keyword is used to
> reference the new object.

###### Prototype constructors

> Prototype is a property of functions in JavaScript. Whenever a
> constructor function is invoked to create a new object, all of the
> characteristics of that constructor\'s prototype are then associated
> to the new object.

###### Module pattern

> Modules are an essential part of any well-constructed web application.
> They are independent blocks linked with each other in a neat,
> understandable and well- organized way. In other words, they give the
> program a structure and also provide encapsulation.

##### Description

> Modules can be implemented in several ways in JavaScript. We will be
> discussing two of them here:

-   Object literal notation

-   The module pattern

###### Object literal notation

> As we have read earlier, object literals are a list of name:value
> pairs separated by commas enclosed inside curly braces {}. Names can
> be identifiers or strings followed by a colon. Make sure there is no
> comma after the last name:value pair; otherwise,
>
> it may result in some unexpected errors:
>
> varObjectLiteral = { variableKey: Value,

*Chapter 10*

> functionKey: function() {
>
> //\...
>
> }
>
> };
>
> We do not have to instantiate object literals with the new keyword.
>
> Care should be taken to see that the keyword new is not used at the
> start of the statement. This is because the opening curly bracket
> could be interpreted as the start of a code block.
>
> We can add new members from the outside object as follows:
>
> myModule.property = \'someValue\';
>
> Using modules can help in hiding data members (encapsulation) and
> managing code in an organized way.

###### The module pattern

> In conventional software engineering, the module pattern provides
> public and private access to classes, methods, and variables. The
> focus of the module pattern is to reduce the use of global variables,
> minimizing the conflicts inside the code throughout the application.
>
> This is the most famous and commonly used design pattern that is
> implemented in large JavaScript frameworks and extension libraries
> such as **jQuery**, **ExtJS**, **YUI**, and **DoJo**.
>
> Here is an example of the module pattern that makes use of a shared
> private cache. This method enables us to create objects using shared
> storage that will, in return, optimize performance because the
> functions are only created one time in the start. The mixin uses the
> function reference to call them rather than creating a new instance of
> that function every time it needs them.
>
> Here are a few advantages and disadvantages of the module pattern:

######## Advantages:

-   This pattern has a cleaner approach for developers

-   It supports encapsulation

-   There is less global namespace cluttering

-   This supports localized functions and variables with closures

> []{#_bookmark428 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

######## Disadvantages:

-   As the public and private members are accessed in a different
    manner, when there is a need to change visibility of a specific
    member we would have to change it everywhere the object was being
    used

-   Private members cannot be accessed from new methods that are added
    to objects afterwards

-   Private members cannot be extended easily

#### The revealing module pattern

> This pattern is almost identical to the module pattern. The only
> difference is that, in this pattern, all members are kept private
> until they are explicitly called, usually by an object literal
> returned by the closure from which it is defined.

##### Description

> Christian Heilmann engineered this pattern. He disliked the fact that
> we had to switch to object literal notation for the objects that we
> want to keep public. There was another drawback: we had to repeat the
> name of main object if we had to access public variables from one
> method into an other or call public methods.
>
> In this pattern, we define all functions and variables as private and,
> at the end of module, return an anonymous object along with the
> pointers to the private functions and variables we would like to
> expose as public.
>
> Here are a few advantages and disadvantages of the revealing module
> pattern:

######## Advantages:

-   Cleaner approach for developers

-   Supports encapsulation

-   Less global namespace cluttering

-   Localized functions and variables with closures

-   More consist script syntax

-   Explicit definition of public functions and variables

-   Increased readability

[]{#_bookmark429 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

######## Disadvantages:

-   Private members are inaccessible

-   It\'s difficult to patch public functions and variables that are
    referred to by some private members

#### The singleton pattern

> This pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and
> provides a global access point to the object.

##### Description

> The singleton pattern is implemented by creating a class with a method
> whose object can only be created if it doesn\'t exist already. If the
> object already existed, the reference will be returned to that object.
>
> It is recommended to delay the initialization of singletons in cases
> where they require some information that might not be available at the
> time of initialization. Hence, they are different from static classes
> or objects.
>
> Here are a few advantages and disadvantages of the singleton pattern:

######## Advantages:

-   Optimized memory usage

-   Single global point of access

-   Delayed initialization, which prevents instantiation until it is
    required

######## Disadvantages:

-   There is no reset option once it is instantiated.

-   Unit testing is difficult because when we reference a singleton
    class that exists outside of the class under test, then we do not
    have a true unit test. Instead of what should have been a single
    unit test of the target class, we end up testing the target class
    and the singleton together.

-   It may introduce hidden dependencies.

#### The observer pattern

> The observer pattern is such that if one object changes state all
> others are notified and can update automatically. Thus this pattern
> defines a one-to-many dependency relationship between objects.
>
> []{#_bookmark430 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

##### Description

> In the observer pattern, an object (also called a subject/publisher)
> is connected to multiple other objects that are dependent on our
> subject. These depending objects are called
> **observers**/**subscribers**.
>
> The subject broadcasts a notification whenever a change in state
> occurs. All observers receive the notification and update them
> accordingly.
>
> The book, *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
> Software*, describes the observer pattern as follows:
>
> *\"One or more observers are interested in the state of a subject and
> register their interest with the subject by attaching themselves. When
> something changes in our subject that the observer may be interested
> in, a notify message is sent which calls the update method in each
> observer. When the observer is no longer interested in the subject\'s
> state, they can simply detach themselves.\"*
>
> Here are a few advantages and disadvantages of the observer pattern:

######## Advantages:

-   Requires a deeper understanding of various components in the system
    and their relationship with each other

-   Helps in pointing out dependencies

-   Helps in disintegrating objects into smaller reusable components

######## Disadvantages:

-   Application integrity check can become difficult

-   Switching an observer from one subject to another can be tough

#### The mediator pattern

> As the name suggests, a mediator is a person who assists in
> negotiations between
>
> two or more conflicting parties.
>
> In terms of software engineering, mediator comes under the behavioral
> design pattern category. The pattern enables us to implement a single
> object through which different components of an application
> communicate.

##### Description

> *Chapter 10*
>
> The mediator pattern promotes loose coupling by ensuring that, instead
> of objects interacting with each other directly, they communicate
> across a central point.
>
> Let\'s take a real-world example to understand it in a better way.
> Consider an airport traffic-control system. The control tower acts as
> a mediator, while all other planes are communicating with the control
> tower and waiting for the notifications to land or
>
> to take off. They do not contact each other but just with the control
> tower. The role of the control tower is very essential and central.
> Hence, it an important key for this system.
>
> Similarly, the mediator is as important in this pattern.
>
> When we call mediator\'s subscribe method, we pass in a callback, and
> the mediator queues up these callbacks for when the given event is
> fired and subsequently the decoupled object\'s callback is fired.
> Mediator triggers the signal for the object to fire, allowing the
> object to be decoupled from any others.
>
> Here are a few advantages and disadvantages of the mediator pattern:

######## Advantages:

-   Removes many-to-many relationships

-   Establishes many-to-one relationship

-   Help us to figure out dependencies

-   Helps in disintegrating objects to promote smaller reusable
    components

######## Disadvantages:

-   Introduces a single point of failure

-   Performance issues may arise when too many modules try to
    communicate back and forth

#### The prototype pattern

> In the prototype pattern, objects are created on the template of the
> existing object through cloning.
>
> []{#_bookmark432 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

##### Description

> This pattern focuses on creating an object that can be used as a
> template/blueprint for other objects through prototypal inheritance.
> JavaScript has native support for prototypal inheritance. Therefore,
> it\'s easy to work in this pattern.
>
> Here are a few advantages and disadvantages of the prototype pattern:

######## Advantages:

-   Suitable for applications where object creation is in focus

-   Better performance as new objects inherit features from the
    prototype

######## Disadvantages:

-   Overkill for an application that has very few objects or prototypes

#### Command pattern

> In this pattern, commands are encapsulated as objects.

##### Description

> Command objects allow loosely coupled systems to separate objects that
> issue requests from the objects that process requests. These requests
> are known as **events** and the code that processes these requests is
> called an event handler.
>
> In simpler words, we can say that the main purpose of the command
> pattern is separating the features of giving out commands from
> executing commands and delegating this feature to a different object.
> Practically, command objects bind an action to the object that will
> invoke the action. They always include a function such as run() or
> execute(). One of the biggest advantages of this pattern is that
> command objects with the same interface can be easily interchanged
> whenever needed.

######## Advantages:

-   The command pattern makes it easier to construct general components
    that have to execute/delegate/sequence method calls

-   Command objects with same interface can be interchanged whenever
    needed

-   It allows bookkeeping about command executions, without interference
    from the client

[]{#_bookmark433 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

######## Disadvantages:

-   It significantly increases the number of classes for each command

> It is useful while creating structures where generation and execution
> of requests do not depend on each other. We can say that a command
> instance can be instantiated by the client and run later by the
> **invoker**. The client and invoker may not know anything about each
> other.
>
> This pattern is scalable as we can add new commands without changing
> any existing code.

#### The facade pattern

> A façade is a front layer that is presented to and is visible to the
> world. Behind it lies all the complexity and unpresentable objects.

##### Description

> The façade pattern is a structural pattern that enables us to hide the
> backend complexities under an interface. This pattern increases
> usability of the application modules. Internal features and methods
> are not exposed directly to developers, but they can interact with
> them through this façade. This pattern makes your application secure.
>
> jQuery is an example of a JavaScript library that uses the façade
> pattern.
>
> Whenever we use jQuery\'s \$(this).animate() or \$(this).css()
> function, we are using a façade. Similarly, \$(document).ready()
> implements a façade.
>
> The core jQuery attributes should be considered intermediate
> abstractions. The more immediate burden to developers is the DOM API
> and facades are what make the jQuery library so easy to use.
>
> The ready() function has lots of complexities at the backend. jQuery
> simplifies
>
> browser inconsistency to ensure that ready() is invoked at the
> appropriate time. However, we only see a façade or a simple interface
> layer.
>
> []{#_bookmark434 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*
>
> Here are a few advantages and disadvantages of the facade pattern:

######## Advantages:

-   Improves a web application\'s security

-   Compatible with other patterns

-   Easier to patch internal modules

-   Easier to implement

-   Provides a simpler public interface

-   Being used in other JavaScript frameworks, such as jQuery

######## Disadvantages:

-   No proven disadvantages

#### The factory pattern

> Just like other creational design patterns, the factory pattern also
> focuses on object creation. However, it differs in the way that it
> does not require a constructor method to create objects.

##### Description

> The factory pattern provides an interface for object creation where we
> specify the type of factory object we need to create. Subclasses are
> allowed to decide which class will be instantiated so that they can
> specify which type of factory object will be
>
> created. Factory pattern is very extensible. Factory methods are used
> when collection of objects are being maintained. These collection of
> objects are different but still have many common methods and
> properties.
>
> In this pattern, we do not use the new keyword to create an object.
> Let\'s take a real-time example that will clarify this pattern:
>
> Suppose there is a garment factory. We need to create a type of
> garment. Instead of creating this object directly using the new
> keyword, we will request a factory object for a new garment. We tell
> the factory which type of object is needed (a shirt, jeans, coat, a
> scarf, and so on). It instantiates that class and returns the object
> for our further usage.
>
> ExtJS is a JavaScript library that uses this pattern. Methods for
> creating objects can be categorized and further sub classed.

[]{#_bookmark435 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

> Here are a few advantages and disadvantages of the factory pattern:

######## Advantages:

-   Object creation is much easier through an interface class, which
    does the process for us

-   Good for creating objects based on different scenarios

-   Practical for similar instantiating objects

-   Creating objects through one instance is simplified

######## Disadvantages:

-   Difficult to test object-creation process as it\'s hidden behind
    factory methods

#### The mixin pattern

> In OOP, mixins are classes that can be inherited by a subclass or a
> group of subclasses for functionality reuse.

##### Description

> Subclassing means to inherit properties for our new object from a
> super or base class object.
>
> For instance, there is an apple class that is able to extend from
> another class, fruit. Here, fruit is a superclass, while apple is a
> subclass of fruit. All objects of apple inherit properties from fruit.
> However, apple is able to define its own methods and override those
> defined by fruit.
>
> If apple needs to call an overridden method in fruit, it\'s called
> method chaining. If apple needs to call fruit\'s constructor, it\'s
> called **constructor chaining**.
>
> Mixins let other objects inherit their functionality with a very
> minimal level of complexity. This pattern allows us to share
> functionalities from many mixins through multiple inheritance.
>
> Here are a few advantages and disadvantages of the mixin pattern:

######## Advantages:

> This pattern helps in decreasing function duplication and promotes
> reuse of functions. In applications where functionality is shared
> across the system, we can put the shared functions in mixins and focus
> on the rest of the distinct functionality in our system.
>
> []{#_bookmark436 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

######## Disadvantages:

> Keeping functionality in the object prototype may result in prototype
> pollution and may confuse tracking the origin of our functions. This
> may cause problems in large- scale applications.

### Property getter and setter

> In programming languages, getting and setting properties are used to
> get and set the values of an object. The getter method is used to get
> values of properties and the setter method is used to set values of
> properties.
>
> There are two property accessors in JavaScript:

-   getter

-   setter

#### Description

-   The getter and setter are methods that help us access and manipulate
    the data within an object very easily. They can help us build
    shortcuts to

> access concealed information. The getter and setter methods work in
> such a way that they bind objects with a function so that they look
> like normal object properties.

-   getter: This method is a special kind of property accessor. When you
    want to access a property, the value is generated dynamically. Here
    is an example:

> Obj.getButtonColor();

-   setter: This method is used to set properties. It passes a value as
    an argument and the returned value of the function is set to the
    property. Here is an example:

> Obj.setButtonColor(value);
>
> []{#_bookmark438 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

### Deleting properties

> Just like we can add properties to objects, JavaScript allows us to
> remove object properties as well.

#### Description

> The delete operator is used to delete a property of an object. It
> deletes properties from the local version. The scope of a property can
> be reassigned to another variable on the same scope. In JavaScript,
> the delete operator always returns a Boolean value. Using this
> keyword, you cannot delete objects declared with the var keyword.
>
> Let\'s assume we have an object like this:
>
> varauthor = { \"name\":\"talha\",
>
> \"age\":\"24\"
>
> };
>
> We wish to remove the age property so that we can have a final object
> that looks
>
> like this:
>
> {
>
> \"name\":\"talha\"
>
> };
>
> Enter the following command:
>
> **deleteauthor.age;**
>
> You can also use this command to achieve the same result:
>
> **delete author\[\"age\"\];**

### Testing properties

> One of the common tests performed by developers on an object is to
> check whether an object has a specific property or not. There are
> different ways to check whether an object has a given property.

[]{#_bookmark439 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

#### Description

> In JavaScript, there are two methods for property testing:

-   hasOwnProperty: This method is used to check whether an object has
    its own property or not. If the property is inherited from anywhere,
    then it will return false:

> For example:
>
> samantha = new girls(); samantha.eyecolor = \'brown\';
>
> o.hasOwnProperty(\'eyecolor\'); // returns true

-   propertyIsEnumerable: This method returns true, only if
    hasOwnProperty

> returns true and that property is enumerable.
>
> To check properties in JavaScript, we can use the in keyword. If an
> object property has its own value, it will return true.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> var girls = {
>
> name: \'Samantha\', height: \'Tall\', eyecolor: \'brown\', address:
> null
>
> };
>
> \'name\' in girls; // true \'age\' in girls; // false

### Enumerating properties

> In JavaScript, enumeration of an object\'s properties is done using
> the for-in loop.

#### Description

> In JavaScript, enumerating properties are used in the for-in loop as
> this loop accesses all properties of an object. When we want to check
> the list of properties of an object, then we use the for-in loop to
> iterate properties. It assigns the name of the property to the loop
> variable.
>
> Inherited objects are not enumerable, but properties that you add with
> these objects are enumerable.
>
> []{#_bookmark440 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*
>
> Here is an example:
>
> var student = { Name:\"Ali\",
>
> Age:\"24\",
>
> Edu:\"Engineering\"
>
> }
>
> Sudent.propertyIsEnumerable(\'Name\');
>
> // will return true since object\'s properties are enumerable
>
> for(var property in student) { Console.log(property); //will log all
> properties
>
> }

### Property attributes

> The information associated with every JavaScript property is called an
> **attribute**. Different types of property attributes are explained
> here.

#### Description

> There are two types of JavaScript properties:

-   Data property

-   AccessorProperty (getter and setter properties) There are four
    attributes that a property has:

-   **Enumerable**: This checks whether the property is in a loop
    construct

-   **Configurable**: This checks whether we can delete or modify a
    property

-   **Writable**: This checks whether we can set the value of a property
    or not

-   **Value**: This is a value of property and it can be of any data
    type in JavaScript

> ![](./images-ref/media/image93.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365780839895013in"}The data property has all of the
> preceding attributes, while the accessor property does not have a
> value or writable attribute.

[]{#_bookmark441 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

#### Object attributes

> There are three types of object properties in JavaScript:

-   **Named data properties**: These are normal object properties in
    which an object maps string name a to a value. Here is an example:

> Var x={ prop:555
>
> };
>
> console.log(x.prop); //its get method c.prop=\"xyz\"; //its set method

-   **Named accessor properties**: Functions that are used to get and
    set properties are known as **named accessor properties**. Here is
    an example:

> Var x = {
>
> get name() { return getter;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> Here\'s another example:
>
> var x = {
>
> set name(val) { console.log(val);
>
> }
>
> }

-   **Internal properties**: Some properties that are not accessible via
    language are called **internal properties** in JavaScript. These
    properties are purely for specification purposes. These properties
    have special names and are written inside square brackets. All
    objects have an internal property known as \[\[Prototype\]\]. The
    value of this property is either null or an object, which is used
    for implementing inheritance.

> It has two parts:

-   **Prototype**: This tells the prototype of an object

-   **Extensible**: This tells us whether we can or cannot add
    properties to an object

> []{#_bookmark442 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

### Serializing objects

> Serializing an object means converting an object into bytes so that it
> can be stored in memory persistently, or it can be sent across the
> network. These bytes can then be deserialized into the original
> object.

#### Description

> Serialization is used to store or preserve the internal state of an
> object. In serialization, an object can be transported or retrieved
> later. There are two methods of serialization in JavaScript:

-   JSON.stringify

-   JSON.parse

> Here is an example:
>
> Obj={a:1} A=json.stringify(obj);
>
> // creates a JSON String from an array or object
>
> B=json.parse(A);
>
> // parses a JSON Object \'A\' in an object.

> These methods can also retrieve and store objects, arrays, strings,

> JSON.stringify() method.

### Objects methods

> Object methods are functions that are stored as object properties.
> These methods can be performed by calling them directly following a
> variable for which the function is to be called and a . (dot).

#### Description

> Every object has methods, which are basically actions performed on it.
> A method is a property of an object.
>
> The toLowerCase(), toUpperCase(), substr(), trim(), charAt(), and
> indexOf() methods are some of the examples of native (part of the core
> language) methods of a string object.
>
> Here is an example using the toUpperCase() method:
>
> var book = \"JavaScript Reference!\"; var result = book.toUpperCase();

[]{#_bookmark443 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

> The value of the result will be:
>
> JAVASCRIPT REFERENCE!

## Functions and methods

> A function is a part of code that does a particular operation that is
> written by the user and called by name independently. A function may
> be passed some data and it may also return some data. On the other
> hand, you can think of methods as defined properties of objects that
> can be called with reference from the object of the class only.
> Objects that are associated with methods are basically window objects.
> The syntax of defining a method and a function is different in
> JavaScript. Methods are only used to define window objects. The way of
> defining a method is different than defining a function in JavaScript.

### Invoking functions

> The four different ways of invoking a function are as follows:

-   Invoking a function as a function

-   Invoking a function as a method

-   Invoking a function as a constructor

-   Invoking a function with a function method

> All these methods were discussed in detail in the previous chapter.
> There is a different way of initializing the this keyword. When you
> call a function, it starts a function. However, when you invoke a
> function, it executes it.

### Defining functions

> When you define a function, your script will not execute, but when you
> invoke a function, the script will execute. A JavaScript function
> performs a particular
>
> task. When any object calls this function, it starts working. To
> define a function in JavaScript, we use the function keyword. A
> function can have multiple parameters depending on the task. You can
> find more detail for this in *Chapter 8*, *JavaScript Implementations,
> Syntax Basics, and Variable Types*.
>
> []{#_bookmark444 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

### Function arguments and parameters

> In JavaScript, a function can have number of arguments. A function may
> be called with a number of arguments. If you do not provide any
> argument in a function, then it will become undefined. Arguments are
> optional in a JavaScript function. If you do not pass any argument in
> a function, then it will set it to default. Here is an example:
>
> Function arg(x,y) { Console.log(x+y); Arg(2);
>
> Arg(2,1);
>
> }
>
> In this example, we passed two arguments in the function: arguments x
> and y. When the first function arg(2) is called, then a=2 and b will
> be undefined. When the second function is called, a=2 and b=1.

### Parameters and return values

> We know we can pass arguments in a function. A function returns a
> value to perform a different operation in your script. There are two
> ways to pass a value into a function:

-   **Pass by value**: When we pass any variable (of primitive data
    types) as an argument in the function, we pass it by value. For
    example, first, the value is

> 2\. After passing, it is 3:
>
> var a=2;
>
> console.log(a); // shows 2 functionpassVal(a);{
>
> a=3;
>
> }
>
> console.log(a); // shows 3

-   **Pass by reference**: When you pass a value to an object, it is
    passed by reference:

> functionpassingVariables(a, b, c) { a = a + 10;
>
> b.value = \"changed\";
>
> c = {value: \"changed\"};
>
> }
>
> varnum = 10;
>
> varvar1 = {value: \"unaffected\"}; varvar2 = {value: \"unaffected\"};

[]{#_bookmark445 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

> passingVariables (num, var1, var2);
>
> console.log(num); // 20 console.log(var1.value); // changed
> console.log(var2.value); // unaffected

### Functions as namespace

> Namespace is a set of logical identifiers grouped together. JavaScript
> does not provide a namespace facility by default. So, for creating
> namespaces in JavaScript, we declare a global object and make all
> functions and properties into that global object, for example:
>
> var stud=student \|\| {}; stud.student=function(name) {
>
> this.name ;
>
> }
>
> var s=new stud.student(\"Ali\");

### Closure

> To write better code, we use closures in JavaScript. Better code means
> code that is creative and expressive. In JavaScript, you encounter
> closures repeatedly, whether you are a good JavaScript programmer or
> not. Depending on how you use closures in your code, it could be
> complex or easy.
>
> Basically, closures are the inner functions of JavaScript used to
> access the outer function\'s scope. There are three scopes of a
> closure:

-   Access of outer function variables

-   Access to its own scope variables

-   Access to its global variables

> Inner functions also have access to outer function variables and
> parameters. In its
>
> own scope, variables are defined in curly brackets. Here is an
> example:
>
> functionstudentName(name) { varstdName=\"Student Name\";
> functionstdLastName(){ returnstdName+name; } returnstdntLastName();
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark446 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

### Function properties

> To define a function in JavaScript, we use the function variable. This
> function can be called anywhere in your script. It could also be a
> function constructor. The attributes and their descriptions are as
> follows:

-   arguments: This is an array passed to a function as an argument

-   argument.length: This tells us the number of arguments in a function

-   constructor: This is used to create an object

-   length: This defines the number on an argument

-   prototype: This allows a function to add object properties

-   arguments.callee: This tells us which function is executing
    currently

### Methods

> Actions performed on objects are known as **methods** in JavaScript.
> They contain function definitions. They are stored as object
> properties in a script. For example, you can create a method like this
> in JavaScript:
>
> Student.FullName = function() {
>
> // define your code here
>
> }
>
> Here FullName is both a property (Student.FullName) and a method
> (Student.FullName()). When you access object properties without
> brackets, this will return a function definition. Here is an example:
>
> Name=Student.FullName;

### Function constructor

> A function constructor is used to define a function dynamically. A new
> operator is use to define a function with the constructor method. You
> can also pass as many arguments you want to use in your script to a
> constructor. The last argument will be the body of the function. It
> can also contain statements separated by commas. Here is an example:
>
> varobj = new Function(\'a\', \'b\', \'return a\*b;\');
>
> We cannot pass the same function name in a constructor as an argument,
> as it will create an error in the script. It can also create an
> unnamed function, known as an anonymous function.

## Classes and modules

> *Chapter 10*
>
> In JavaScript, we do not have any native approach to creating classes,
> but we can create a class using prototype inheritance and a
> constructor function.
>
> Classes are containers for objects. We use classes to encapsulate a
> namespace and logic.
>
> To instantiate a class, we can use the new keyword. Classes are
> similar to constructor functions. Here is an example:
>
> function student(nameI) { This.name=name; this.age=\'18\';
>
> }
>
> student.prototype.std=function() {
>
> //define some code
>
> };
>
> module.export=student;
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image94.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.33658683289588803in"}Modules are used to include and extend
> classes and properties easily. Modules attach properties to global
> objects to export module values.
>
> Classes and their modules are extremely important and vital aspects of
> JavaScript. We will be covering the following topics in the subsequent
> sections:

-   Classes and prototypes

-   Constructors

-   Java-style classes in JavaScript

-   Augmented JavaScript

-   Types of classes

-   Subclasses

-   Classes in ECMA5 script

-   Modules

### Classes and prototypes

> In JavaScript, a class is an object with special types of properties
> and methods. It is used to create instances and define the behavior of
> instances. Instances\' behavior changes dynamically and we have a
> special syntax to write it in JavaScript. Instances are created when
> special methods are invoked on a class.
>
> []{#_bookmark448 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*
>
> Prototypes and functions are two different things in JavaScript. A
> constructor can be any function, but a prototype is a special kind of
> object. To define a behavior of any instance, we use a prototype.
> There are no special properties or methods a prototype has. When we
> modify a prototype, we have instances.
>
> In simpler words, we can say that in JavaScript, a constructor can be
> any function that is responsible for creating an instance. On the
> other hand, a prototype can be any object that has no special methods
> or properties. Prototypes are responsible for an instance\'s behavior.
>
> In JavaScript, the prototype and constructor functions act like a
> class, because a class
>
> has a constructor, and to define methods, you have a prototype:
>
> Here is an example:
>
> //Constructor Function
>
> var Cat = function(name) { this.Name = name; this.Meow = function() {
>
> console.log(this.Name + \" meow\");
>
> };
>
> }
>
> //Prototype object method var Cat = function(name) {
>
> this.Name = name;
>
> }
>
> Cat.prototype.Meow = function() { console.log(this.Name + \" meow\");
>
> };
>
> //Both gives same results var cat = new Cat(\"Capri\"); cat.Meow();
>
> There are no special properties or objects associated with a
> prototype. An object in your script can be an empty project or a
> prototype. When we say that any object can be a prototype, then this
> object will have functions and data types. Prototypes are not special
> kinds of objects, but classes are special kinds of objects in
> JavaScript.

### Constructors

> A class contains a set of objects, and for initialization of the
> objects, we use constructors. In a class, we can create objects using
> the new operator. We can define a class as a subclass to construct
> objects.

[]{#_bookmark449 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

> With a single property of prototype, a constructor is created. If we
> overwrite the prototype property, the reference to the constructor
> might be lost. In JavaScript, we use the constructor property to
> create a class from an object that is passed as an object. Here is an
> example:
>
> var color = \'black\';
>
> function Cat() {
>
> // public property this.color = \'\';
>
> // private constructor
>
> var construct = function(that) { console.log(\"I have a Cat!\");
> that.color = \'brown\';
>
> }(this)
>
> // getter
>
> this.getColor = function() { returnthis.color;
>
> }
>
> // setter
>
> this.setColor = function(color) { this.color = color;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> var b = new Cat();
>
> console.log(b.getColor()); // should be brown b.setColor(\'white\');
> console.log(b.getColor()); // should be white console.log(color); //
> should be black

### Defining a class

> There are three ways of defining a class in JavaScript:

-   Using a function

-   Using object literals

-   A singleton using a function

> []{#_bookmark450 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

#### Using a function

> You can create an object using the new keyword in a function. To
> access methods and properties, use the this keyword. There would be a
> conflict if you define a function with the same name in a class.

#### Using object literals

> To define an object or array in JavaScript, we use literals. Here is
> an example:
>
> Varobj= {}; Varobj=\[\];

### Classes in the ECMA5 script

> For specific objects\' properties, the ECMA5 script added five
> methods. These methods are used to secure and restrict the
> extensibility of objects in the script. These methods are:

-   Enumerable

-   Writable

-   Getter

-   Setter

-   Configurable

> When we define a class in JavaScript, these methods are very useful.
> When you store
>
> an object, it sets an object ID for these methods. When we use a
> looping statement, it will return this object ID. All objects inherit
> the object ID, which is enumerable. To read a property, it will invoke
> the getter function, and there will be no setter function. So, it will
> be read-only. We cannot modify it, so it cannot be deleted.

### Modules

> The two very important aspects of modules are:

-   **They have dependencies**: This means that when you write a module
    in your system, it is fully dependent on the function. We import
    dependencies from functions while creating our application.

-   **They have exports**: If you leave some function and variable
    public in your system, anything can export these. For example, you
    have exported a function \$function, module that depends on this
    function will also have access to this function.

[]{#_bookmark451 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

> A module can export a number of multiple variables and functions. To
> export these functions and variables, we use the export keyword. Here
> is an example:
>
> Export function sub(a,b) { Return a+b;
>
> }
>
> We can also store a variable after exporting it. Here is an example:
>
> Var string=function(a,b) { Return a+b;
>
> }

## Inheritance {#inheritance-2}

> JavaScript supports prototype inheritance. In other programming
> languages, objects and classes inherit from each other to use each
> other\'s properties and functions.
>
> However, in JavaScript, you have an object-based inheritance, which is
> called a prototype, in which objects use the properties of other
> objects. For example, if you have a Person object, then you can use
> the \_proto\_ attribute for that object to create another Student
> object:

![](./images-ref/media/image95.png){width="0.9097484689413823in"
height="1.25in"}

### Prototype chaining

> In JavaScript, you create new objects from existing objects. This
> process is called
>
> **prototype chaining**. It is similar to inheritance in
> object-oriented systems.
>
> []{#_bookmark452 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

#### Description

> Prototype is a property of the constructor function. When you add any
> object property to a prototype, it will add this property or method to
> the objects created by the constructor function. In prototype
> chaining, we create a function prototype using the properties of the
> constructor function. Using this, all methods or properties transfer
> to the prototype object from the constructor function. This method is
> very easy and useful for creating the constructor function to create
> objects. Here is an example:
>
> function person(name) { this.name=name;
>
> }
>
> person.prototype= { sayHi:function() {
>
> console.log(\"something\");
>
> }
>
> Function student(name) { This.name=name;
>
> }
>
> }
>
> Student.prototype=new Person(); Varstd=new student(\"Ali\");
> Std.sayHi();
>
> In method resolution, first JavaScript checks objects for methods.
> When you use prototype chaining, it can override methods for
> prototypes of an object. So, the JavaScript construction function sets
> methods for objects.

### Constructor stealing

> In JavaScript, constructor stealing is also called **classical
> inheritance**. This method is use to inherit problems of prototype
> reference values.

#### Description

> In constructor stealing, we call a super constructor in a subtype
> constructor. This idea is quite simple and easy. We use the call() and
> apply() methods for function calling. Here is an example:
>
> function super() { this.name=\[\"Ali\"\];
>
> }
>
> function sub() {

[]{#_bookmark453 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

> super.call(this);
>
> }
>
> varstd=new sub(); std.name.push(\"Ali\"); varstd1= new sub();
> console.log(std1.name);
>
> In this example, we used the call() method to call a super constructor
> for a newly created subclass instead of a subconstructor. This will
> initialize all objects in the super() function on sub().
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image96.png){width="0.4178423009623797in"
> height="0.3365748031496063in"}When we use prototype chaining, the
> constructor function will allow us to pass arguments from a super
> constructor to within the subconstructor.

### Combination inheritance

> Combination inheritance is also called **pseudo-classical
> inheritance**. This is a combination of constructor stealing and
> prototype chaining.

#### Description

> In combination inheritance, prototype chaining inherits properties and
> methods from a prototype, and constructor stealing inherits instances.
> In this way, we can reuse methods on prototypes by allowing methods to
> have their own properties. Here is
>
> an example:
>
> functionSuperType(name) { this.name = name;
>
> this.colors = \[\'yellow\', \'purple\', \'indigo\'\];
>
> }
>
> SuperType.prototype.sayName = function() {
>
> //console.log(this.name);
>
> };
>
> functionSubType(name, age) {
>
> //inherit properties SuperType.call(this, name); this.age = age;
>
> }
>
> //inherit methods
>
> SubType.prototype = new SuperType(); SubType.prototype.sayAge =
> function() {
>
> //console.log(this.age);
>
> []{#_bookmark454 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*
>
> };
>
> varinstance1 = new SubType(\'John Doe\', 26);
> instance1.colors.push(\'white\');
>
> //console.log(instance1.colors); //\'yellow,purple,indigo,white\'
> instance1.sayName(); //\'John Doe\';
>
> instance1.sayAge(); //26
>
> varinstance2 = new SubType(\'Kate\', 21);
>
> //console.log(instance2.colors); //\'yellow,purple,indigo\'
> instance2.sayName(); //\'Kate\';
>
> instance2.sayAge(); //21
>
> In this example, the SuperType constructor defines two properties:
> name and colors. The SuperType prototype has a single method called
> sayName(). The SubType constructor calls the SuperType constructor,
> passing in the name argument, and defines its own property called age.
> Additionally, the SubType prototype is assigned to be an instance of
> SuperType, and then, a new method called sayAge() is defined. With
> this code, it\'s then possible to create two separate instances of
> SubType that have their own properties, including the colors property,
> but all use the same methods. Addressing the downsides of both
> prototype chaining and constructor stealing, combination inheritance
> is the most frequently used inheritance pattern in JavaScript. It also
> preserves the behavior of instanceof and isPrototypeOf() to identify
> the composition of objects.

### Prototypal inheritance

> In prototypal inheritance, we use an object as a base for another
> object.

#### Description

> In prototypal inheritance, there are no classes, only objects. To
> create an object, you can either create a totally new object or you
> can clone an existing object. New objects can be then extended with
> new properties.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> varobject=Object.create(null);
>
> The preceding object has no prototype and is a clone of null:
>
> var rectangle = { area: function () {
>
> returnthis.width \* this.height;
>
> }
>
> };
>
> varrect = Object.create(rectangle);

[]{#_bookmark455 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

> In the preceding example, rect inherits the area function from
> rectangle. Here, rectangle is an object literal, an object literal is
> a way to create a clone of Object.prototype.
>
> It can also be written as follows:
>
> var rectangle = Object.create(Object.prototype);
>
> rectangle.area = function () { returnthis.width \* this.height;
>
> };
>
> We can extend the newly created object as follows:
>
> rect.width=50; rect.height=100; console.log(rect.area());
>
> We can create a constructor function that will clone rectangle for us
> and will extend it with the height and width properties:
>
> var rectangle = {
>
> create: function (width, height) { var self = Object.create(this);
> self.height = height;
>
> self.width = width; return self;
>
> },
>
> area: function () { returnthis.width \* this.height;
>
> }
>
> };
>
> varrect = rectangle.create(50, 100); console.log(rect.area());

### Parasitic inheritance

> Parasitic inheritance is similar to prototypal inheritance.

#### Description

> It simply works by creating a function that performs inheritance,
> object
>
> augmentation, and finally, it returns the object after completing each
> task:
>
> Function abc(x) {
>
> Var clone=obj(abc);
>
> []{#_bookmark456 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*
>
> Clone.sayHi=function() {
>
> };
>
> return clone;
>
> }
>
> Var student= { Name=\"Ali\";
>
> };
>
> Varstd=new abc(student); Std.sayHi();
>
> Here, in this example, we have the abc() function that has one
> argument, which is an object based on a new object. This object is
> passed to the object function and saves the resulting object into a
> clone variable. Now, the clone object will have a new object property,
> and at the end, we return the object.

### Parasitic combination inheritance

> A parasite is defined as an organism that lives inside another
> organism and relies on its resources. Similarly, in this inheritance,
> a child object relies on a parent object and extends its properties
> from it.

#### Description

> The first constructor calls the subtype prototype and then it calls
> the subtype constructor. This is a very efficient way of creating new
> objects in JavaScript. At the end, the subtype will have all the
> properties of the super type. Here is an example:
>
> function super(name) { this.name=\[\"Ali\"\];
>
> }
>
> super.prototype.sayHi=function() { console.log(\"something\");
>
> }
>
> function sub(age) { this.age=age; super.call(this,name);
>
> }
>
> sub.prototype=new super(); sub.prototype.sayHi();
>
> The only difference between parasitic combination inheritance and
> combination inheritance is that, in the former one, the base
> constructor is called once, and in the latter one, the base
> constructor is called twice.

### Subclasses

> *Chapter 10*
>
> In every programming language, every subclass has a super class that
> inherits its properties and methods from. JavaScript is not a pure
> class-based programming language, but it follows some of the rules of
> OOP. We make classes in JavaScript using object notations.
>
> In JavaScript, you can only perform inheritance using the constructor
> function or prototype. This inheritance is only done at run time,
> which means dynamically. Here is an example:
>
> // super class functionsuperClass() {
>
> this.bye = superBye; //method 1 this.hello = superHello; //method 2
>
> }
>
> //sub class functionsubClass() {
>
> this.inheritFrom = superClass; //inherit-from method defines
>
> superclass
>
> this.inheritFrom(); //inherit from method called
>
> this.bye = subBye; method 1 overridden in subclass
>
> }
>
> functionsuperHello() {
>
> return \"Hello from superClass\";
>
> }
>
> functionsuperBye() {
>
> return \"Bye from superClass\";
>
> }
>
> functionsubBye() {
>
> return \"Bye from subClass\";
>
> }
>
> To run the preceding code execute following method:
>
> functionprintSub() { varnewClass = new subClass();
> console.log(newClass.bye());
>
> console.log(newClass.hello());
>
> }
>

## Built-in objects

> To add flexibility in language, JavaScript supports a number of
> built-in objects. The
>
> most commonly used objects are:

-   Global

-   Date

-   Math

-   RegExp (Regular Expression)

-   Array

> Implementations of these built-in objects are complex and different.

### Global objects

> Global objects are objects defined outside the function. Every
> function can access these variables because their scope is global for
> all.
>
> When you do not declare a variable and assign a value to it, then it
> will automatically become global.

#### Description

> When your code starts execution, functions and constants immediately
> become available. A global variable does not initialize with the new
> keyword. Basically, global objects are used to share same data to add
> properties. You can store methods within global objects in your
> script.
>
> Objects that you cannot access directly for accessing those object we
> use global objects. We pass those object directly as arguments after
> declaring the global variable. You can create a number of instances
> and a number of global objects in your script.
>
> A global object has a fixed number of properties. Multiple object
> instances can access this global object. Here is an example:
>
> varstudentName=\"Ali\" functionmyStd(){ }
>
> student=new Global(\"name\"); student.age=18;
>
> person=new Global(\"name\"); post(person.age);

### Date object

> *Chapter 10*
>
> Date objects in JavaScript deal with date and time objects. For
> example, if we are writing a script and we need some functionality of
> date and time, then we can use this built-in object simply.

#### getTime()

> This function is used to get the current time with respect to the
> number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970.

##### Parameters

> There are no parameters passed.

##### Returns

> The number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970.

##### Description

> As the name states, this function is used to obtain the current time,
> in the form of
>
> milliseconds. We need to create a date object first.
>
> var time = new Date();
>
> time.getTime(); // This will output time as 1454905019871

#### getMilliseconds()

> This function is used to get the current time with respect to the
> number of milliseconds.

##### Parameters

> There are no parameters passed.

##### Returns

> A number from 0-999.

##### Description

> As the name states, this function is used to obtain the current time,
> in the form of
>
> milliseconds. We need to create a date object first.
>
> var time = new Date(); time.getMilliseconds();
>
> []{#_bookmark460 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

#### getMinutes()

> This function is used to get the current time with respect to the
> number of minutes.

##### Parameters

> There are no parameters passed.

##### Returns

> A number from 0-59.

##### Description

> This function is used to obtain the current time, in the form of
> minutes. We need to

>
> var time = new Date(); time.getMinutes();

#### getHours()

> This function is used to get the current time with respect to the
> number of hours.

##### Parameters

> There are no parameters passed.

##### Returns

> operations. This object has several mathematical functions. Here is an
> example:

-   Math.E

-   Math.PI

-   Math.sqrt

-   Math.Ln2

-   Math.ln10

> The math object has different methods. For example, we have the pow

### The RegExp object

> In JavaScript, for pattern matches in string, we use a regular
> expression. It is a very powerful and useful tool for expression
> pattern matching.

#### Parameters

> The following are the parameters:

-   **Pattern**: The text/pattern of the regular expression

-   **Flags**: If specified, flags can have any combination of the
    following:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   g: Global match

-   i: Ignore case

-   m: Multiline; treat beginning and end characters (\^ and \$) as
    working over multiple lines (that is, match the beginning or end of
    each line (delimited by \\n or \\r), not only the very beginning or
    end of the whole input string)

[]{#_bookmark467 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

#### Returns

> The return type of different regular expressions is different.

#### Description

> Using a regular expression, you can make a complex task simple by
> writing
>
> few lines of codes. There are five methods in JavaScript:

-   RegExp.exec(pattern)

-   RegExp.replace(pattern)

-   RegExp.split(pattern)

-   RegExp.match(pattern)

##### Defining a regular expression

> There are two ways of writing a regular expression in JavaScript.
> These are:

-   RegExp constructor method

-   Literal syntax

> ![](./images-ref/media/image97.png){width="0.41783792650918633in"
> height="0.336580271216098in"}There are differences between the RegExp
> object and global object. They look the same but act differently.

##### RegExp constructor

> This method is used to dynamically construct a string search pattern.
> A regular expression in this method should be written in quotation
> marks. This method has three parameters. Here is an example:
>
> var email=new RegExp(\"\\d{2},\"g\");
>
> In this example:

-   E-mail is a required parameter to which regular expression values
    are assigned

-   \\d is a pattern parameter used to match regular expression

-   g is global, which is a flag parameter. In this function, there are
    four types of parameters (g, I, m ,u).

> []{#_bookmark468 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*

##### Literal syntax

> In literal notation, we write a regular expression without brackets.
> Here, i is a flag that shows to ignore case of the text whether it is
> uppercase, lowercase or any other. We have more flag objects such as
> the following ones:

-   g: Global object

-   i: Ignore case

-   m: Multi search

-   u: Unicode search

> In regular expressions, we can have a global regular expression
> object, which will have information for each match case. A simple
> regular expression object has information about a particular regular
> expression:
>
> var exp=\\d{2}/i

### String object

> There are four string methods for pattern matching. In these objects,
> a pattern is sent with a parameter. These methods allow you to search,
> match, replace, and split patterns.
>
> These methods are represented as follows.

#### Match(pattern)

> This method is used to find a matching pattern within a string. Using
> the not (!)
>
> operator it can also be used to find non-matches.
>
> The syntax is string.Match(Expression).

##### Parameters

> The string pattern that is to be matched.

##### Returns

> It returns the result if a match is found or 0 or null if no match is
> found.

##### Description

> This runs a search for matching strings in a regular expression. If
> the search is matched or successful then it will return an array of
> matching results, if not then it will return null or 0. It is also
> used to update properties in a regular expression.

[]{#_bookmark469 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

> Here is an example:
>
> var str=(\"I have 10 dollars\");
>
> //The pattern below is used to find non-digits in a string var
> parsestring= str.match(/\\D/g);
>
> // Outputs I, ,h,a,v,e, , ,D,o,l,l,a,r,s

#### Replace(pattern)

> This method is used to replace a part of the string.
>
> The syntax is string.replace(stringSearched, stringReplacement).

##### Parameters

> The string pattern that is to be replaced is passed as a parameter.

##### Returns

> The string with the replaced value.

##### Description

> This executes a search and is used for replacement of regular
> expression match resulted with alternative text. This is also used for
> replacement of regular expressions with specific and different regExp
> properties.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> var str1=(\"Apple Pie\");
>
> var parsestring1=str1.replace(\"Pie\", \"Cinnamon Roll\");
>
> Here the value of parsestring1 is Apple Cinnamon Roll.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image98.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.33658683289588803in"}Remember here that the search is case
> sensitive, so if you provide the value
> parsestring1=str1.replace(\"piE\", \"Cinnamon Roll\"); then no
> replacement is done.
>
> Also, only the first occurrence of the pattern is replaced. Hence:
>
> var str1=(\"Apple Pie , Banana Pie\", \"Strawberry PIE\"); var
> parsestring1=str1.replace(\"Pie\", \"Cinnamon Roll\");
>
> Here the value of parsestring1 is Apple Cinnamon Roll, Banana Pie,
> Strawberry PIE.
>
> []{#_bookmark470 .anchor}*[JavaScript Object-Oriented
> Programming]{.underline}*
>
> To perform a global search and replacement so that all occurrences are
> replaced we use the following code:
>
> var str1=(\"Apple Pie , Banana Pie\", \"Strawberry PIE\"); var
> parsestring1=str1.replace(/Pie/g, \"Cinnamon Roll\");
>
> Here the value of parsestring1 is Apple Cinnamon Roll, Banana Cinnamon
> Roll, Strawberry PIE.
>
> For a global insensitive search, use the following code:
>
> var str1=(\"Apple Pie , Banana Pie, \"Strawberry PIE\"); var
> parsestring1=str1.replace(/Pie/gi, \"Cinnamon Roll\");
>
> Here the value of parsestring1 is Apple Cinnamon Roll, Banana Cinnamon
> Roll, Strawberry Cinnamon Roll.

#### Split(pattern)

> This is use to split a string in a regular expression. The syntax is
> string.split(separator,limit).

##### Parameters

> A separator and limit are provided as optional parameters.

##### Returns

> The split string is returned.

##### Description

> With this method the string is split. Every word in the string is
> treated as a single element in an array. If a null string is passed as
> a parameter, the method causes each letter to be split into different
> characters. For example:
>
> var str1 = \"My Car is at the garage in Queens\"; var parseString =
> str1.split(\"\");
>
> The value of parseString will be:
>
> M,y, ,C,a,r, ,i,s, ,a,t, ,t,h,e, ,g,a,r,a,g,e, ,i,n, ,Q,u,e,e,n,s

[]{#_bookmark471 .anchor}*Chapter 10*

> Providing a limit will return a comma separated array of the words
> containing only
>
> the specified number of elements. For example:
>
> var str1 = \"My Car is at the garage in Queens\"; var parseString =
> str1.split(\" \", 3);
>
> The value of parseString is My,Car,is.
>
> Using a letter or letters as a separator will give the following
> results:
>
> var str1 = \"My Car is at the garage in Queens\"; var parseString =
> str1.split(\"a\");
>
> The value of parseString will be:
>
> My C,r is ,t the g,r,ge in Queens
>
> Here is another example:
>
> var str1 = \"My Car is at the garage in Queens\"; var parseString =
> str1.split(\"ar\");
>
> The value of parseString will be:
>
> My C, is at the g,age in Queens

#### search(pattern)

> This method is used to search for a particular string. The syntax is
> string.search(stringSearched).

##### Parameters

> The string pattern that is to be searched is passed as a parameter.

##### Returns

> It returns the position of the starting letter of the string if a
> match is found. If no match is found then it returns -1.

##### Description

> It is used to find a match in a string. If a match is found it will
> send an index of that match otherwise, if a match is not found, it
> will return -1. Global flags are not supported by this method.

### Array objects

> An array is a collection of objects.
>
> To create an array in JavaScript, the elements of the collection are
> enclosed within square brackets and separated by commas, as seen here:
>
> varcolors = \[\"red\", \"yellow\", \"blue\"\]
>
> An array can also be initialized using the new keyword or by
> specifying their length between 0 and 232-1:
>
> new array(first, second, third, ... )
>
> new array(7) // creates an array of size 7
>
> To access array elements, we can use an index notation:
>
> varlastColor = colors\[2\]; // blue
>
> Always remember that array elements always start with the zero index.
> Hence, the third element in the preceding array has the index of 2.
>
> Array objects can hold all sorts of data, for example, strings,
> numbers, literals, dates,
>
> and even user-defined objects.

# Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript 6

> ECMA 262 is a standard that defines the core features of the
> JavaScript language. The language that is defined by this standard is
> called **ECMAScript**. JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript.
> It runs in web browsers at the client end, while Node.js runs at the
> server end. ECMAScript 6 was released in June 2015. ES6 is a major
> update from ES5, which was released in 2009.
>
> A complete language specifications draft of ES6 language
> specifications can be
>
> obtained from <https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html>.

## Compatibility and goals

> The ES6 compatibility chart shows which features of ES6 are supported
> in the current
>
> browsers. It also links all listed features to their specification
> guides.

![](./images-ref/media/image101.jpeg)

> Reference: Use ECMAScript 6 Today

[]{#_bookmark480 .anchor}*Chapter 11*

> ECMA6 script has the following major goals:

-   Default exports

-   Static structure of modules

-   Support for asynchronous and synchronous loading

-   Used for dependencies between modules

## JavaScript subset and extensions

> Subsets are mostly defined for security purposes; scripts written
> using secure language subsets can be executed safely even if its
> source is untrusted, for instance, an ad server. Some of these subsets
> will be described later.
>
> As JavaScript continued to evolve and allowed explicit extensions,
> newer versions were released. Many of the features were standardized.
> These extensions are compatible with modern browsers such as Firefox
> and Chrome. However, the implementation of non-standard extensions may
> require an external compiler because these features are being updated
> in major JavaScript engines now.

### JavaScript subsets

> As stated earlier, for execution security of untrusted code, we use
> subsets in JavaScript. For example, when we have a credit card
> checking script in which a credit card number is sent to a remote
> server, then for this type of information security, we use subset. By
> defining a subset, we check the behavior of a program that we have
> strictly not allowed. So, it means that we use subsets for a certain
> amount of code, and the other part of the code is omitted.
>
> There are two goals of a JavaScript subset:

-   The subset construct should be added to maximize coverage use of
    JavaScript constructs

-   It is used to extend analysis to accommodate changes

> These subset are defined for every reason.
>
> []{#_bookmark481 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript
> 6]{.underline}*
>
> **The good parts**: This is a subset that is part of the language used
> for the best and the worthy part of the script. The main goal of this
> subset is it purifies and simplifies code, and makes the script easier
> and more understandable. The good parts subset does not have an eval()
> function. It also eliminates the continue
>
> and with statements. It does not include function definition
> statements, and only defines function using the function definition
> expression. Using a function definition statement, it defines a
> function, and then, after defining the function, it does not use the
> function definition statement.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image102.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365748031496063in"}In subset curly brackets, we have a body
> of loops and conditional statements. If there is a single statement in
> the body, then it would not allow the brackets to be omitted.

#### Secure subsets

> There are various implementations of secure subsets. Some of them are
> briefly
>
> described here.

##### ADsafe

> **ADsafe** (<http://www.adsafe.org/>) was one of the first presented
> security subjects. It was proposed and created by Douglas Crockford.
> ADsafe uses tools such **asJSLint** (<http://www.jslint.com/>) to
> verify the unsafe code. It enforces good programming practices, so the

> Instead, it allows the script to access the ADsafe object, which

##### Dojox

> The **dojox.secure** tool
> ([https://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.10/](https://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.10/dojox/secure.html)
> [dojox/secure.html](https://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.10/dojox/secure.html))
> is a security subset inspired from ADsafe. It is an extension of the
> **Dojo** toolkit ([http://dojotoolkit.org](http://dojotoolkit.org/))
> and was developed by Kris Zyp. It is fully packed with components that
> ensure safe execution and loading of untrusted code, content, ads, and
> widgets from a different domain. It provides a sandbox environment and
> limited DOM elements for interaction:

##### Caja

> **Caja** (<https://developers.google.com/caja/>) is an open source
> secure subset powered by Google. Caja (which means \"**box**\" in
> Spanish) further defines two subsets:

-   **Cajita** (which means \"**small box**\" in Spanish) is a narrow
    subset just like ADsafe and dojox.secure

-   **Valija** (which means \"**suitcase**\" in Spanish) is a broader
    subset and is much more similar to ECMAScript in strict mode (with
    the eval() method removed)

> Caja is a compiler tool that transforms third-party content such as
> HTML, CSS, and JS into secure code, which is then easy to embed in a
> website.

##### FBJS

> **FBJS** (<https://github.com/facebook/fbjs>) is a JavaScript secure
> subset used by Facebook. It allows untrusted code to be executed in a
> secure environment.
>
> It transforms code to ensure security. During the transformation, all
> top-level identifiers are renamed by adding the module-specific
> prefix. Adding module specific prefix prevents querying any global
> identifiers. For example, you are developing an app having the xyz123
> ID, and there is a foo() function in the code. It will eventually
> become xyz123_foo(). Even function calls to eval() are redirected to a
> non-existent function.

##### Microsoft\'s web sandbox

> Microsoft\'s **Web Sandbox** (<http://www.websandbox.org/>) defines a
> broad secure
>
> subset of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Sandbox implements host
> virtualization to provide security and extensibility. The untrusted
> code is executed in a virtual
>
> machine instead of running directly in a browser. A virtual machine
> quarantines the untrusted code, which prevents it from interacting
> with the elements outside the virtual machine. Let\'s take a look at
> the following block diagram:

### JavaScript extensions

> Lots of new and useful features have been coded. They will be
> standardized with the release of ES6. ES6 was set to be officially
> released in June 2015. However, many of the features and extensions
> are already available on Firefox and Chrome (Experimental JavaScript
> flag has to be turned *on* in order to access some of the ES6
> features). We will discuss the major features in the rest of the
> chapter.

### Const

> It works like variable keyword var. For declaring a constant, we use
> the word const. In order to use assignment we must declare constant.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image105.png){width="0.4178423009623797in"
> height="0.3365748031496063in"}Values declared with the const can not
> be redeclared, redefined or reinitialized. JavaScript provide 8
> constants through math object. One of them is PI. we can not
> reinitialize PI using const.

### Let

> *Chapter 11*
>
> The Let keyword is used for the block scoping of variables. The
> variables are declared at the start of the code instead of at the
> start of functions:
>
> var name = \"john\"; console.log(name);
>
> In the preceding example, the name john is the value of name logged in
> console. The declarations in JavaScript are moved to the top. The
> position of the variables declared or initialized in the scope of the
> function does not matter, and they will be hoisted to the top by
> default. JavaScript\'s default conduct is to move variable
> declarations to the top.
>
> Hoisting is JavaScript\'s default behavior to move variable
> declarations to the top.
>
> Variables in JavaScript are function scoped. This means, variables are
> available throughout the function, even if they are declared in a
> nested code block. Here is a short example in which we will log the
> output in the console of our client, that is, Chrome, Firefox, and so
> on:
>
> var name = \"john\"; (function () {
>
> // var name = undefined; if (!name)
>
> { var name = \"jane\"; } console.log(name); // \"jane\"
>
> }());
>
> From the preceding example, the value of name used to log-in into the
> console is
>
> jane.
>
> ES6 handles this issue with let. Let is very much like var. The only
> difference is that let is block scoped, and var is function scoped. We
> can rewrite the previous example using let, as shown here:
>
> var name = \"john\"; (function () {
>
> // var name = undefined; if (!name) {
>
> let name = \"jane\";
>
> }
>
> console.log(name); // \"john\"
>
> }());
>
> []{#_bookmark485 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript
> 6]{.underline}*
>
> Notice that although the value of name is jane inside the function,
> using the let keyword sets its scope to global and the value of name
> defaults to john. Hence, john is logged in the client\'s console.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image106.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365748031496063in"}If we declare a variable as a constant,
> assign it some value, use the same constant somewhere else that
> changes its value, then its new value will be ignored. Like variables,
> we can add constants anywhere in our script without breaking our code.

### Destructuring assignment

> We can assign multiple values to the variables in a function using one
> command.

### For each

> The iteration of property value is done using this loop. The iteration
> of property name is done.

### Iterator

> The object for the next method is returned. The object that is
> returned has \_ iterator\_ property. The iterator is used for
> iteratable objects.

### Generators

> The generation of object is done here. A generated object is returned
> whenever a function invokes the this method. The yield keyword is
> used. The current execution of the function is specified by the
> generated object.

### Array

> The iteratable objects with the same values in the array are
> shorthanded by the use of array.

### Generator expression

> The functions are shorthanded for multiple try-catch expressions. The
> thing that is returned is the generated object wrapped in {} and not
> in \[\]. We use this for multiple values to variables in the function.

## Scoped variables and constants

> *Chapter 11*
>
> When we declare a variable, then it has a local scope and a global
> scope. We can define a variable anywhere in our script. When we
> declare a variable in JavaScript, we can assign a value to it at the
> time of declaration or later. Here is an example:
>
> \_xyz123; // variable declared without assigning a value to it varabc
> = \"Star\"; //variable declared while assigning a value to it
>
> In JavaScript, a variable is defined by a dollar sign the same as in
> query. In JavaScript, we create variables dynamically using the var
> keyword. Every variable has a name and a value associated with it.
> These values can be of any type, such
>
> as number, array, string, and so on. A variable name could be a
> combination of characters and numbers. Here is an example:
>
> (a==undefined){ a=5}
>
> A variable that is declared outside a function is a **global
> variable** having a global scope. This means that it can be accessed
> from anywhere within a script.
>
> We can also declare a variable constant with the const keyword. A
> constant variable value is constant.
>
> Constants can be defined using the const keyword as shown here:
>
> Const a=5;
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image107.png){width="0.41784120734908137in"
> height="0.33657261592300963in"}The const and let keywords work in a
> similar way that they both are block scoped. However, in the case of
> const, values cannot be redeclared, redefined, or reinitialized. In
> short, const values are read-only.
>
> Here is a working example:
>
> const PI = 3.14159265359;
>
> console.log(\"value of PI = \" + PI); //value of PI = 3.14159265359 PI
> = 3.1415; //\<\-\-\-\-\-\-- Can not re-assign value to PI
> console.log(\"value of PI = \" + PI); //value of PI = 3.14159265359
> const PI = 2.0312; //\<\-\-\-\-\-\-- Can not re-initialize value of PI
>
> []{#_bookmark487 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript
> 6]{.underline}*
>
> console.log(\"value of PI = \" + PI); //Uncaught TypeError:
>
> Identifier \'PI\' has already been declared
>
> var PI = 9.2144; //\<\-\-\-\-\-\-- Can not re-declare value of PI
>
> console.log(\"value of PI = \" + PI); //Uncaught TypeError: Identifier
> \'PI\' has already been declared.
>
> The class variables are declared in the class but not within methods
> of any class, whereas the local variable exits within the methods of
> any class.

## Shorthand functions

> Shorthand function, also known as **expression closure**, is a
> technique to use simple functions in JavaScript. It is used to omit a
> function\'s curly brackets in the event; it returns a true or false
> statement. Similarly, if you omit the return keyword, it would also
> send you the exact same result.
>
> The expression will be evaluated quickly after the argument list in
> your script by omitting the curly brackets and the return keyword.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> Let student=function(a) A+1, yes
>
> Function() True,no
>
> This behaves similarly like functions. They are defined with curly
> brackets and a return statement. This is very useful when we want to
> pass a function as an argument to a function.

## Multiple catch clauses

> In JavaScript, try/catch statements are use to handle exceptions
> present in the try
>
> code blocks.

### The try clause

> In the try block, the statements to be evaluated are executed.

[]{#_bookmark488 .anchor}*Chapter 11*

> ![](./images-ref/media/image108.png){width="0.3199486001749781in"
> height="0.3996576990376203in"}If you want to deliberately throw an
> exception, we would use the throw statement. This will abort the
> execution of the remaining statements, and the control will move to
> the catch block.

### The catch clause

> After checking and encountering an error in the statements in the try
> block, the exception block is called. If the exception encountered is
> the same as the exception handled in the catch block, then the control
> immediately shifts to the catch block, and the statements within the
> catch block are executed.
>
> The statements presented after the erroneous statement will *not* be
> executed, unless there is a return statement in the finally block.
>
> A good practice is to use a conditional catch clause first if we
> anticipate that any exception will occur. An unconditional catch
> clause is placed last to handle all the remaining exceptions:

> try {
>
> demotrycatchfunction(); // may throw any type of exceptions

### The finally clause

> This block will execute statements present within at end, whether an
> exception has occurred or not. The statements in a finally block
> execute irrespective of whether an error occurred. The finally block
> generally contains code that must be executed regardless of anything.
> Hence, we generally release resources and close connection inside a
> finally block. The syntax for writing a simple try-catch-finally block
> is as follows:
>
> try {
>
> //try code - This is the Code block to try
>
> }
>
> catch(error) {
>
> //catch code -- This is the Code block that handle errors
>
> }
>
> finally {
>
> //finally code - This is the Code block to be executed regardless of
> try catch results
>
> }
>
> We can also write this with a nested catch blocks like this:
>
> try {
>
> //do something
>
> }
>
> catch (Exception e) { try {
>
> //do something with little likeliness of output
>
> }
>
> catch (Exception ex) { try {
>
> //do the minimum acceptable
>
> }
>
> catch (Exception e1) {
>

## E4X -- ECMAScript for XML

> It is an extension in JavaScript for support of XML extension with
> JavaScript. By using E4x, it provides easy access for XML document by
> the DOM interface. It is a server-side technology used in **Rhino**
> and **SpiderMonkey** because these are powerful extensions by all
> browsers.
>
> Before E4X, it was very difficult and time consuming for reading and
> writing in XML. In JavaScript, E\$X provides XML document as a XML
> object, which represents XML fragments as a xmlList. E4X supports
> special kinds of XML objects. This technique is used in client-side
> programming.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> varstudent=\<student\>
>
> \<studentInfo\>
>
> \<name\>Ali\</name\>\</studentInfo\>
>
> \</student\>
>
> If we enter this XML into our JavaScript code, the E4X interpreter
> will handle it as an XML object in your script.

## ECMAScript 6 features

> ECMAScript 6, otherwise called **ECMAScript 2015**, is the most recent
> form of the ECMAScript standard. ES6 is an important upgrade to the
> language, and the first update to language since the release of ES5.1
> in June 2011
>
> A few of the new features of ES6 are:

-   Arrow functions

-   Classes

-   Enhanced object literals

-   Destructuring assignment

-   Extended parameter handling

-   Generator

-   Modules

-   Proxy

> We will look at all these functions in the upcoming sections.

### Arrow functions

> *Chapter 11*
>
> Arrow functions are also known as **fat arrow functions**. It is a
> function and is similar to what we use in C#, Java, and Coffee Script.
> Statements and expression bodies are supported by arrows. The lexical
> of arrows is similar to its surrounding code. This is not the case in
> functions.
>
> As the name suggests, arrow functions use a shorter syntax, an arrow
> (=\>), for
>
> definition and in syntax.
>
> For example, look at the following example:
>
> // An empty arrow function returns undefined let empty =()=\>{};
>
> (()=\>\"pine\")()// returns \"pine\"
>
> var simple = a =\> a \>20?20: a; simple(20);// 20
>
> simple(10);// 10
>
> let max =(a, b)=\> a \> b ?a : b;
>
> // Easy array filtering, mapping, \...
> varsampleArray=\[7,4,1,0,3,5,11\];
>
> var sum =sampleArray.reduce((a, b)=\> a + b);// The answer is 29 var
> even =sampleArray.filter(v =\> v %2==0);// The answer is \[4, 0\] var
> odd =sampleArray.filter(v =\> v %2!=0);// The answer is \[7, 1, 3, 5,
> 11\]
>
> var double =sampleArray.map(v =\> v \*2);// The answer is\[14, 8, 2,
> 0, 6, 10, 22\]
>
> An arrow function expression or a fat arrow function are shorter in
> syntax when compared with function expressions. Arrow function is used
> to bind the value of this. (It does not binds its own arguments,
> super, this or new.target). Arrow functions are anonymous.
>
> The yield keyword is used to pause and resume a generator function
> (function\* function keyword with an asterisk defines a generator
> function that returns a Generator object).

### Classes

> ES6 classes\' syntax is simpler and easier than that of area
> syntactical sugar over the prototype-based object-oriented pattern. It
> is a syntactical sugar. One-time
>
> declaration makes class patterns easier to use and simplifies the use
> of class patterns. Classes support constructors, instance,
> prototype-based inheritance, static methods, and super calls.
>
> Here is an example of writing a class in ES6 and ES5:
>
> //ES5
>
> functionsomeES5Class(fname, age) { // standard way to create an object
> prototype i.e. constructor function
>
> this.fname = fname; this.age = age;
>
> }
>
> someES5Class.prototype.sayName = function() { //prototype property
> enables us to add new functions to an existing prototype
>
> console.log(this.fname);
>
> }
>
> someES5Class.prototype.sayAge = function() { //prototype property
> enables us to add new functions to an existing prototype
>
> console.log(this.age);
>
> }
>
> varmyInstance = new someES5Class(\'Talha\', 25); //new keyword is used
> with a constructor function to create new objects from the same
> prototype
>
> myInstance.sayName(); //the new method can then be called as a regular
> member
>
> myInstance.sayAge();
>
> /\*Output:
>
> Talha 25\*/
>
> //ES6
>
> classsomeES6Class { // ES6 class
>
> constructor(fname, age) { // a constructor is defined with default
> parameters
>
> this.fname = fname; this.age = age;
>
> }

### Enhanced object literals

> Object literals is one of the most popular patterns of JavaScript.
> JSON is based on object literals. The reason for its popularity is
> that it provides a very quick, short, and neat way to do key:value
> assignments, define methods, evaluate expressions, and make super
> calls. ES6 has extended the object literal syntax in various ways.
> This makes them more useful. Two types of extensions for object
> literals are explained here.

#### Property initializer shorthand

> Earlier in ECMAScript 5, object literals were a comma-separated
> collection of name:value pairs. There was a likelihood of duplication
> while property values were being initialized.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> functioncreateStudent(StudentID, name, class) { return {
>
> StudentID: StudentID, name: name,
>
> class: class,
>
> };
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark495 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript
> 6]{.underline}*
>
> In the preceding example, the createStudent() function creates a
> student object whose name and class properties are similar to the
> function parameters. This results in duplication of name and class
> properties, even though both behave differently.
>
> To correct this, the initializer shorthand property was introduced in
> ECMAScript 6. This removed all the likelihood of duplication between
> property names and local variables.
>
> For instance, createStudent() can be revised as follows:
>
> functioncreateStudent(StudentID, name, class) { return {
>
> StudentID, name, class,
>
> };
>
> }
>
> In the event that property name will be the same as property
> estimation, you can simply incorporate property name without colon and
> value.
>
> If the property of an object literal has no value, the JavaScript
> engine searches for a variable with a similar name in the surrounding.
> If the search procedure is successful, the value is assigned to the
> same party name in object literals.

#### Method initializer shorthand

> With the advent of ECMAScript 6, many things improved, making the work
> of a web developer simpler. The syntax of writing methods in object
> literals improved to a great extent. Earlier, in ECMAScript 5, we
> needed to specify a name and write the complete function definition
> then and there.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> varcustomer = { name: \"Samantha\",
>
> logName: function() { console.log(this.name);
>
> }
>
> };

[]{#_bookmark496 .anchor}*Chapter 11*

> With ECMAScript 6, the syntax became easier to code. Colon and
> function keywords have been removed. The same example can be rewritten
> as follows:
>
> varcustomer = { name: \"Samantha\", logName() {
>
> console.log(this.name);
>
> }
>
> };
>
> person.logName();varobject = {
>
> // prototype
>
> prototype : theProtoTypeObj,
>
> // Shorthand for \'handler: handler\' handler,
>
> // Methods toString() {
>
> // Super calls
>
> return \"x \" + super.toString();
>
> },
>
> // Dynamic property names
>
> \[ \'property\_\' + (() =\> 20)() \]: 20
>
> };

### Template strings

> Template strings amplify ECMAScript with syntactic sugar to build
> string. This component is like string introduction highlights in Perl,
> Python, and so on. You can likewise add a tag to permit redid string
> development, staying away from and counteracting infusion assaults or
> building complex information structures from
>
> string substance. They also enable us to create **domain-specific
> languages** (**DSLs**) to deal with content in a safe way.
>
> Instead of adding more extending functionality to JavaScript strings,
> template strings provide a total new approach for string
> interpolation.

#### Basics

> The simplest format of a template string is as follows:
>
> literal\${substitution_variable}literal
>
> This is the most basic form of template strings which performs
> substitutions.
>
> []{#_bookmark497 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript
> 6]{.underline}*
>
> Template strings are enclosed within backticks (\`) instead of single
> or double quotes. Here is an example:
>
> letbasic_string = \`Kung Fu Panda\`;
>
> console.log(basic_string); // \"Kung Fu Panda\"
> console.log(typeofbasic_string); // \"string\"
> console.log(basic_string.length); // 13
>
> In this example, a basic_string variable contains a simple JavaScript
> string. The template string syntax is only used to create the string
> value, which is then assigned to basic_string.
>
> If there is a need to use a backtick in string, then you can escape it
> using a backslash (\\):
>
> letbasic_string = \`\\\`Kung Fu\\\` Panda.\`; // \`Kung Fu\' Panda

#### Multiline strings

> In this type of string, we can add multiple lines in a single line of
> code. To insert a new line in a string, we have to include \\n within
> the string manually, as follows:
>
> letmultiline_string = \"Kung Fu Panda, \\n\\ Releasing in 2016\";
>
> console.log(multiline_string);
>
> The output of this is:
>
> Kung Fu Panda Releasing in 2016
>
> We need to be careful regarding the whitespaces, as whitespaces within
> backticks are considered to be part of the string. All whitespaces
> before the second line are considered to be part of the string.

### Destructuring assignment {#destructuring-assignment-2}

> In JavaScript, *destructuring* means pattern matching. In ES6, we can
> do efficient pattern matching in objects and arrays. Earlier, this was
> a long and complicated task. Here are some working examples written in
> a client console.
>
> []{#_bookmark498 .anchor}Fetching data from objects and arrays is very

#### Array destructuring

> All variables can be initialized and swapped at once instead of the
> conventional way of creating a temporary variable:
>
> var \[ first, last \] = \[\"one\", \"hundred\"\] // initialize
> console.log(first + \" to \" + last); // one to hundred
>
> \[first, last\] = \[last, first\] // variable swapping
> console.log(first + \" to \" + last); // hundred to one
>
> Multiple values from a function are returned with ease using array
> destructuring. We don\'t have to wrap around an object. To skip
> variables, you can leave the position of the array element blank:
>
> function dob() {
>
> return \[29, \"November\", 1990, \"Thursday\"\];
>
> }
>
> var \[date, month, year, day\] = dob();
>
> console.log(\"My date of birth is on \" + date + \" \" + month); // My
> date of birth is on 29 November
>

#### Object destructuring

> that is returned from a function even with deeply nested objects.
>
> Destructuring enables variables to be initialized from an object that
> is returned by a function having deeply nested objects. Just like
> Array destructuring, we can skip the ones not needed. Here\'s the
> working snippet:
>
> function dob() { return {
>

>
> }
>
> var { date: d, month: m, time : { hour: h, meridian: p } } = dob();
>
> // h is the nested property while year and minute is skipped
>
> console.log(\"I was born on \" + d + \" \" + m + \" at \" + h + \"
> \" + p); // I was born on 29 November at 12 AM

### Extended parameter handling

> Functions are an important and fundamental part of any language. ES6
> has introduced a number of incremental improvements in functions. This
> makes them less error prone and more powerful.
>
> Functions allow any number of parameters to be passed irrespective of
> the number of parameters in the function definition. There are three
> types of these parameters that could be passed to functions:

-   Default

-   Rest

-   Spread

#### Default parameter

> *Chapter 11*
>
> ES6 lets us set default parameters. A parameter with a default value
> is considered optional. It binds trailing parameters to an array:
>
> function multiply(x, y) {
>
> y = typeofy !== \'undefined\' ? y : 1;
>
> returnx\*y;
>
> }
>
> multiply(10);

#### Rest parameter

> Rest parameters replace the need for arguments and addresses common
> cases more directly. Rest parameters are indicated by three dots (...)
> preceding a parameter.
>
> Here is an example showing the rest parameter:
>
> //Rest Parameter function sum(...nums) {
>
> var result = 0; nums.forEach(function(number) {
>
> result += number;
>
> });
>
> return result;
>
> }
>
> console.log(sum(1)); // 1
>
> console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6
>
> The named parameter becomes an array containing the rest of the
> parameters. Adding more than one named argument may cause syntax
> error.

#### Spread operator

> Spread operator is very similar to the rest parameter, but it allows
> us to split the array to individual arguments, which are then passed
> to the function as separate arguments.
>
> Here is an example showing the spread operator:
>
> //Spread Operator functionsum2(a, b, c) {
>
> return a + b + c;
>
> }
>
> varargs = \[1, 2\];
>
> console.log(sum(...args, ...args, 3)); // 6
>
> []{#_bookmark501 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript
> 6]{.underline}*
>
> Here is an example showing the usage of default, rest, and spread
> parameters:
>
> function sum() { return ;
>
> }
>
> console.log(sum( (1, 2)
>
> //Spread Operator
>
> //Rest Parameter
>
> //Default Parameter Values
>
> //Default Parameter Values functioninc(num, increment = 1) {
>
> returnnum + increment;
>
> }
>
> console.log(inc(2, 2)); // 4
>
> console.log(inc(4)); // 5

### Bindings

> The let keyword is a new var. The declaration syntax for the let
> keyword is the same as for var. You can basically replace var with let
> to declare a variable but keep its scope to the current code:
>
> functiongetCuisine(condition) {
>
> if (condition) {
>
> letcuisine = \"Mediterranean\";
>
> // other code
>
> returncuisine;
>
> }
>
> else {
>
> // cuisine does not exist here
>
> return null;
>
> }
>
> // cuisine does not exist here
>
> }

[]{#_bookmark502 .anchor}*Chapter 11*

> Variables defined using const are considered to be constants, so the
> value cannot be changed once set. For this reason, every const
> variable has to be initialized:
>
> // Valid constant const ITEMS = 10;
>
> // Syntax error: missing initialization const ITEM;

### Iterators and the for\...of operator

> We use iterators to allow customization of an object\'s iteration
> method/behavior, such as CLRIE numerable or Java Iterable. Generalize
> the for..in operator to custom iterator-based iteration with for..of.
> Iterators are an important feature of ECMAScript 6. When used in
> combination with new array methods and new types of collections (for
> example, sets and maps), iterators become even more important for the
> efficient processing of data.
>
> Fibonacci numbers, or the Fibonacci arrangement, are the numbers in
> the accompanying whole number succession:
>
> let fibonacci = { \[Symbol.iterator\]() {
>
> let x = 0, y = 1; return {
>
> next() {
>
> \[x, y\] = \[y, x + y\];
>
> return { done: false, value: y }
>
> }
>
> }
>
> }
>
> }

### Generators {#generators-2}

> Custom iterators are a useful tool but it requires careful programming
> so that it can maintain its internal state explicitly. ES6 introduced
> generators which provide a powerful alternative. Generator allows us
> to create an iteration algorithm by writing a single function. This
> single function is able to maintain its own state.
>
> A generator is a function that returns an iterator. The generator
> functions are denoted by embedding an asterisk (\*) after the function
> keyword. A normal function becomes a generator if it contains a yield
> expression and uses function\* syntax.

> height="0.3996555118110236in"}It doesn\'t matter whether there is
> space between the function keyword and the asterisk.
>
> The yield keyword is utilized within the generators function to
> indicate the qualities that the iterator must return when the next()
> method is called. So, in the event that you need to return unique
> values for each progressive call to next():
>
> We can convert the previous iterator example to use a generator, as
> shown here:
>
> let fibonacci = {
>
> \*\[Symbol.iterator\]() { let prex = 0, cury = 1 for (;;) {
>
> \[ prex, cury \] = \[ cury, prex+curv \] = \[ yield cury

### Better Unicode support

> ES6 supports Unicode, including new Unicode literal form in strings,
> new RegExp u mode to handle code points, as well as new APIs to
> process strings at the 21-bit code points level. These updates enable
> us to create global apps in JavaScript. ECMAScript 6 enforces encoding
> of strings in UTF.

[]{#_bookmark504 .anchor}*Chapter 11*

> The supported Unicode examples are as follows:
>
> // same as ECMAScript 5 \"𝌆\".length == 2
>
> // new RegExpbehaviour, opt-in \'u\' \"𝌆\".match(/./u)\[0\].length ==
> 2
>
> // new form \"\\u{1D306}\"==\"𝌆\"==\"\\uD834\\uDF06\"
>
> // new String ops \"𝌆\".codePointAt(0) == 0x20BB7
>
> // for-of iterates code points for(var c of \"𝌆\") {
>
> console.log(c);
>
> }

### Modules {#modules-2}

> ECMAScript 6 enables us to export and import symbols to and from
> modules without polluting the global namespace. It provides added
> support for modules for component definition. Runtime behavior is
> defined by a host-defined default loader. It is an implicitly
> asynchronous model; no code is executed until the necessary modules
> are available and processed:
>
> export function sum(x, y, { return x + y
>
> }
>
> console.log(\"4π = \" + math.sum(math.pi, math.pi, math.pi, math.pi));
>
> console.log(\"2π = \" + sum(pi, pi));

### Module loaders

> Module loaders are used primarily to resolve module specifiers,
> loading modules, and so on. They are responsible for downloading the
> required modules and binding them asynchronously. This brings to light
> the dependencies of a client script. The constructor is
> Reflect.Loader.
>
> Module loaders support:

-   Compilation hooks

-   Nested virtualization

-   Dynamic loading

-   Global namespace isolation

-   State isolation

#### Loader methods

-   System.module(source, options?): This is used to assess the
    JavaScript code in source to a module (which is delivered and
    returned non-concurrently by means of a guarantee)

-   System.set(name, module): This is used for the registration of the
    module created by System.module()

-   System.define(name, source, options?): This is used to assess the
    module code in source and registers the outcome

> We can configure the default module loader, and new loaders can be
> constructed to
>
> evaluate and load code in isolated or constrained contexts:
>
> System.import(\'libraries/math\').then(function(mx) { console.log(\"π
> = \" + (mx.pi));
>
> });
>
> // Create execution sandboxes -- new Loaders var loader = new Loader({
>
> global: fixup(window)
>
> });
>
> loader.eval(\"console.log(\'live to code!\');\");
>
> // Directly manipulate module cache System.get(\'jquery\');
> System.set(\'jquery\', Module({\$: \$}));

### Collections

> *Chapter 11*
>
> **Collections** are used to create unique values collections of any
> type in JavaScript. In a collection of values, you can also add and
> remove values. There is no direct access to values in collection, and
> these are of array type.
>
> In ECMAscript 6, collections are a new efficient way to store data.
> JavaScript arrays are similar to other programming language arrays
> with index. By use of these arrays, you can pull double and triple
> data and also stack data. There are many new types of collections in
> JavaScript. Here are some examples:

-   Sets

-   Maps

-   WeakMap

-   WeakSet

#### Sets

> A set has a unique collection of values. The unique values of a set
> are also of object reference types. Values in sets cannot be
> duplicated. Before you access values from a set, you need to check
> whether the values are present or not.
>
> We can add values in a set and also check the size of values in a set.
> Here is an example:
>
> Var students=new set(); Students.add(10); Students.add(\"Ali\");

#### Maps

> A map object is a key/value map. Any value in map may be used as a key
> or a value. Elements can iterate in a map in an insertion order, and
> it returns an array of a value or a key. There are two properties of
> map:

-   Map.length: Returns the number of elements in a map

-   Map.prototype: The Map.prototype property represents the prototype
    for the map constructor

> Here are some of the methods of the map object.
>
> []{#_bookmark507 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript
> 6]{.underline}*

##### Map.prototype.clear()

> The clear() method removes all elements from a map object.

###### Returns

> It returns nothing.

###### Parameter

> There is no input parameter.

###### Description

> After using this function, everything that we have initialized on map
> will be erased. The function has no parameter and returns nothing as
> it wipes out everything.
>
> Here is an example of this method:
>
> varmyMap=newMap(); myMap.set(\"pine\",\"apple\");
>
> myMap.set(1,\"apple\");
>
> myMap.size;// 2
>
> myMap.has(\"cone\");// will return false myMap.has(\"pine\")// will
> return true

##### Map.prototype.delete()

> The delete() method removes the specified element from a Map object.

###### Returns

> It returns true if a component in the map object existed and has been
> evacuated. It returns false if the component does not exist.

###### Parameter

> A key is required. The key here is basically the element to be
> removed.

###### Description

> This is different from map.prototype.clear() as it clearly removes a
> specific element instead of deleting every element on the map. We pass
> a key (the element to be deleted), and the function returns true or
> false, depending on the key.

[]{#_bookmark508 .anchor}*Chapter 11*

> Here is an example of this method:
>
> varmyMap=newMap(); myMap.set(\"pine\",\"apple\");
>
> myMap.delete(\"apple\");// Returns true. Successfully removed.
> myMap.has(\"apple\");// Returns false. The \"apple\" element is no
> longer present.

##### Map.prototype.entries()

> This function is used to tell us about the key and value of elements
> on map.

###### Returns

> It returns a new iterator object that contains a key and a value for
> every element on the map.

###### Parameter

> There are no input parameters.

###### Description

> This function is utilized for letting us know about the key and value
> of components on map.
>
> Here is an example of this method:
>
> varmyMap=newMap(); myMap.set(\"0\",\"pine\");

> console.log(mapIter.next().value);// \[\"0\", \"pine\"\]
>
> console.log(mapIter.next().value);// \[1, \"apple\"\]
> console.log(mapIter.next().value);// \[Object, \"cone\"\]

##### Map.prototype.forEach()

> The forEach method executes the given callback once to every key/value
> pair in the map object.

###### Returns

> It returns nothing.
>
> []{#_bookmark509 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript
> 6]{.underline}*

###### Parameter

> There are three parameters: the element value, element key, and the
> map object being traversed.

###### Description

> The forEach strategy executes the given callback once to every key of
> the guide that really exists. It is not conjured for keys that have
> been erased. Nonetheless, it is executed for values that are
> available; however, they have the value defined.
>
> Here is an example of this method:

>
> // logs:
>
> // \"m\[pine\] = 3\"
>
> // \"m\[apple\] = \[object Object\]\"
>
> // \"m\[cone\] = undefined\"

##### Map.prototype.get()

> A specific element from the map is returned using the get() method.

###### Returns

> It returns the key that is used as a parameter (only if it is found in
> map); or else, it returns an error message.

###### Parameter

> It requires a key that is to be returned from the map.

###### Description

> We input a key that we want to find in the map, and the function
> returns it. It is used
>
> when we want to get the value of an element. Here is an example of
> this method:
>
> varmyMap=newMap(); myMap.set(\"apple\",\"pine\");
>
> myMap.get(\"apple\");// Returns \"apple\". myMap.get(\"cone\");//
> Returns undefined.

##### Map.prototype.has()

> *Chapter 11*
>
> The function returns true (Boolean value) if the element exists and
> false if it does not.

###### Returns

> It returns true if a component with the specified key exists in the
> map object. If not found, it returns false.

###### Parameter

> A key is required.

###### Description

> We pass a key in the function to check whether a certain element
> exists in the map or not. If the element exists, true is returned;
> otherwise, false is returned.
>
> An example of this method is shown here:

##### Map.prototype.keys()

> It returns keys for every element in the map.

###### Returns

> It returns a new object that contains the keys of all elements on the

##### Map.prototype.set()

> This is the procedure to add a new element on map.

###### Returns

> It returns the map object.

###### Parameter

> This is the key of the element to be added on map.

###### Description

> This method removes the specified object from WeakSet.

###### Returns

> Returns true if the value is found in WeakSet and is deleted. Returns
> false if the value is not found.

###### Parameter

> The value to be deleted is sent as a parameter.

###### Description

> The delete() strategy expels the predefined element from a WeakSet
> object. It is used while we need to delete some element from WeakSet.

>
> myWeakSet.add(window);
>
> myWeakSet.delete(myObject);// Will return false

>
> myWeakSet.has(window);// Will return false.

##### WeakSet.prototype.has(someValue)

> This method will return true if the object exists in WeakSet;
> otherwise, false is returned.

###### Returns

> *Chapter 11*
>
> It returns true if a component with the predefined value exists in the
> WeakSet object; otherwise, it returns false.

###### Parameter

> Requires a value that is to be searched.

###### Description

> The has() technique gives back a Boolean demonstrating whether an item

### Proxies

> Proxies enable object creation with a wide range of behaviors
> available to host objects. They can be used for object virtualization,
> interception, logging/profiling, and so on. Proxies provide developers
> with an unprecedented control over objects and unlimited possibilities
> to define new interaction patterns.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> vartargetObject = {}; varhandlerObject = {
>
> get: function (receiver, book) { return \`Title, \${name}!\`;
>
> }
>
> };
>
> varproxyObject = new Proxy(target, handler); proxyObject.world ===
> \'Lahore!\';
>
> // Proxying a function object
>
> vartargetObject = function () { return \'Target, I am\'; };
> varhandlerObject = {
>
> apply: function (receiver, \...args) { return \'Le proxy\';
>
> }
>
> };
>
> var p = new Proxy(target, handler); p() === \'Le proxy\';

### Symbols

> A symbol is a unique type which can be used as an identifier for
> object properties.
>
> The symbol object is an implicit object wrapper for the symbol
> primitive data type. Here is how you can create a new primitive
> symbol:
>
> var symb = Symbol();
>
> OR
>
> var symb = Symbol(\'abc\');

*Chapter 11*

> The preceding code creates two new symbols. Symbol(\'abc\') does not
> force converts abc into an object but creates a new separate object.
>
> Symbol(\'abc\') === Symbol(\'abc\'); //false
>
> Using Symbol() with new keyword will throw a type error.
>
> var symb = new Symbol(); // TypeError
>
> This prevents creation of an explicit Symbol wrapper object instead of
> a new symbol value. Creating an explicit wrapper object around
> primitive data types were only supported until ES5. However, existing
> primitive wrapper objects like new Boolean, new String and new Number
> can still be created for legacy reasons.
>
> And if it is necessary to create Symbol wrapper object, you can use
> the Object()
>
> function:
>
> var symb = Symbol(\"abc\"); typeof symb; // \"symbol\" var symbObj =
> Object(symb); typeof symbObj; // \"object\"
>
> The Object.getOwnPropertySymbols() method returns an array of symbols
> and
>
> lets you find symbol properties on a given object.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> varSomeClass = (function() { var key = Symbol(\"key\");
>
> functionSomeClass(privateData) { this\[key\] = privateData;
>
> }
>
> SomeClass.prototype = { doStuff: function() {
>
> \... this\[key\] \...
>
> }
>
> };
>
> returnSomeClass;
>
> })();
>
> var c = new SomeClass(\"bye\") c\[\"key\"\] === undefined

### Subclassable built-ins

> In ECMAScript 6, built-ins such as Date, Array, and DOM elements can
> be subclassed. Object construction for a function named Ctor now uses
> two phases:

-   Call Ctor\[@@create\] to allocate the object and install any special
    behavior

-   Invoke constructor on new instance to initialize it

> The known @@create symbol is available via Symbol.create. Built-ins
> now expose their @@create syntax explicitly.

> // Pseudo-code of Array classSomeArray {
>
> constructor(\...args) { /\* \... \*/ } static \[Symbol.create\]() {

>
> // User code of Array subclass classSomeArray extends Array {
>
> constructor(\...args) { super(\...args); }
>
> }
>
> // Two-phase \'new\':

> // 1) Call @@create to allocate object
>
> // 2) Invoke constructor on new instance vararr = new SomeArray();
>
> arr\[1\] = 123;
>
> arr.length == 1

### Promises

> ECMAScript 6 introduced promises. It is a library used for
> asynchronous programming. It is a first-class representation of a
> value that may be made available in the future. Many existing
> JavaScript libraries already use promises.
>
> Some of the methods for promises in ES6 are mentioned here.

#### Promise.All()

> *Chapter 11*
>
> This method returns a promise that is resolved once all the promises
> in the iterable argument have been resolved. In the case of a
> rejection, it returns with the reason of the first-passed promise that
> was rejected.

##### Returns

> The Promise.All() method returns nothing.

##### Parameter

> An iterable object, such as an array.

##### Description

> Promises returns result as an array of values. If any value in the
> array is not a promise, then it is converted using Promise.resolve. If
> any of the passed in promises rejects, then all promise are rejected
> and the reason of rejection of a promise is returned. It discards all
> other promise whether they have been resolved or not. If an empty
> array is passed, then this method resolves immediately.
>
> An example of this method is shown here:
>
> varprom1 = 6000;
>
> varprom2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { setTimeout(resolve,
> 100, \"Here\");
>
> });
>
> Promise.all(\[prom1, prom2\]).then(function(values) {
> console.log(values); // \[6000, \"Here\"\]
>
> });

#### Promise.prototype.catch()

> This method is used only in cases where objects are rejected. It works
> the same as
>
> promise.prototype.then().

##### Returns

> The promise.prototype.catch() method returns nothing.

##### Parameter

-   **One rejected**: A function called when the promise is rejected.
    This function has one argument, the rejection reason.

> []{#_bookmark522 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript
> 6]{.underline}*

##### Description

> The catch() technique gives back a promise and manages rejected cases.
> It behave similar as calling Promise.prototype.then(undefined,
> onRejected).
>
> An example of this method is as follows:
>
> varprom1= new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { resolve(\'This was
> Successful!!\');
>
> });
>
> prom1.then(function(value) {
>
> console.log(value); // \"This was Successful!!\" throw \'oh, no!\';
>
> }).catch(function(e) { console.log(e); // \"Error found\"
>
> }).then(function() { console.log(\'Catch Done!\');
>
> }, function () {
>
> console.log(\'Not fired due to the catch\');
>
> });

#### Promise.resolve(value)

> This method returns a promise object that is resolved by the specified
> value. If the value is associated to a then method, the returned
> promise will move to the then method, adopting its final state.
> Otherwise, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the specified
> value.

##### Returns

> The promise object that is resolved with the given value.

##### Parameter

> Let\'s take a look at the following parameters and their use:

-   onFulfilled: A function called when the Promise is fulfilled

-   onRejected: A function called when the promise is rejected

##### Description

> The Promise.resolve(value) system gives back a Promise question that
> is determined with the given quality. On the off chance that the
> quality is a then able (that is, has a then technique), the returned
> promise will *follow* that then able, adopting its possible state.

*Chapter 11*

> The then() technique gives back a Promise. It takes two contentions:
> callback capacities for the achievement and disappointment instances
> of the Promise.

###### Using the then method

> An example of this method is as follows:
>
> varprom1=newPromise(function(resolve, reject) { resolve(\"This was a
> Success!\");
>
> // or
>
> // reject (\"Error Found Try Again!\");
>
> });
>
> prom1.then(function(value) { console.log(value);//This was a Success!
>
> },function(reason){
>
> console.log(reason);// Error Found Try Again!
>
> });

###### Chaining

> As the then() method returns a Promise, you can easily chain then
> calls:
>
> varp2=newPromise(function(resolve, reject) { resolve(1);
>
> });
>
> p2.then(function(value) { console.log(value);// 1
>
> return value +1;
>
> }).then(function(value) { console.log(value);// 2
>
> });
>
> p2.then(function(value) { console.log(value);// 1
>
> });
>
> You can also use chaining to implement one function with a
> Promise-based API on top of another such function:
>
> functionfetch_current_data() {
>
> returnfetch(\"current-data.json\").then((response)=\> {
> if(response.headers.get(\"content-type\")!=\"application/json\") {
>
> thrownewTypeError();
>
> }
>
> var j =response.json();
>
> []{#_bookmark523 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript
> 6]{.underline}*
>
> // maybe do something with j
>
> return j;// fulfillment value given to user of
>
> // fetch_current_data().then()
>
> });
>
> }

#### Promise.reject(value)

> This function returns a promise object that is rejected because of the
> passed value/reason.

##### Returns

> The Promise.reject() method returns a simple output telling the reason
> for rejection.

##### Parameter

> Reason why this promise is rejected.

##### Description

> The static Promise.reject() function capacity gives back a Promise
> that is rejected. For troubleshooting purposes and specific mistake
> finding, it is helpful to make the reason an instance of error.
>
> An example of this method is shown here:
>
> Promise.reject(\"Testing Promise reject\").then(function(reason) {
>
> // not called
>
> },function(reason) {
>
> console.log(reason);// \"Testing Promise reject\"
>
> });
>
> Promise.reject(newError(\"fail\")).then(function(error) {
>
> // not called
>
> },function(error) { console.log(error);// Stacktrace
>
> });

#### Promise.race(value)

> This function returns a promise that is resolved or rejected the same
> way as the promises passed in iterable, with the value or reason from
> that promise.

[]{#_bookmark524 .anchor}*Chapter 11*

##### Returns

> The Promise.race() function returns a promise.

##### Parameter

> An iterable object, such as an array.

##### Description

> The race function gives back a Promise that is settled the same route
> as the initially passed Promise to settle. It determines or rejects,
> whichever happens first.
>
> An example of this method is as follows:
>
> varmyPromise1=newPromise(function(resolve, reject) {
> setTimeout(resolve,800,\"first\");
>
> });
>
> varmyPromise2=newPromise(function(resolve, reject) {
> setTimeout(resolve,300,\"second\");
>
> });
>
> Promise.race(\[myPromise1,myPromise2\]).then(function(value) {
> console.log(value);// \"second\"
>
> // Both resolve, but myPromise2 is faster
>
> });

### Core math library APIs

> ECMAScript 6 has made several new extensions to the prebuilt
> libraries, including core Math libraries, arrays, string helpers, and
> Object.assign for copying.
>
> These new methods help in speeding up the execution process, hence
> resulting in enhancing the performance of applications that may
> perform calculations and string manipulation. It also improves the
> speed of applications that must perform many calculations and string
> manipulations.
>
> Numerous new library increases, including core Math libraries, array
> conversion helpers, string helpers, and Object.assign for copying. An
> example of using the Core Math Library APIs is as follows:
>
> Number.EPSILON
>
> Number.isInteger(Infinity) // will return false Number.isNaN(\"NaN\")
> // will return false
>
> Math.acosh(3) // 1.762747174039086
>
> Math.hypot(3, 4) // 5
>
> []{#_bookmark525 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript

> Math.imul(Math.pow(2, 32) - 1, Math.pow(2, 32) - 2) // 2
>
> \"Neptune\".includes(\"cd\") // This will return false
> \"Mars\".repeat(4) // This will be \"MarsMarsMarsMars\"
>
> Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\'\*\')) // Returns a real Array
> Array.of(1, 2, 3) // Similar to new Array(\...), but without special

> \[0, 0, 0\].fill(2, 1) // \[0,2,2\]
>
> \[24, 14, 23, 57, 89, 75, 33\].find(x =\> x == 33) // 33
>
> \[24, 14, 23, 57, 89, 75, 33\].findIndex(x =\> x == 14) // 1
>
> \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\].copyWithin(3, 0) // \[1, 2, 3, 1, 2\]
>
> \[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"\].entries() // iterator \[0, \"x\"\],
> \[1,\"y\"\], \[2,\"z\"\] \[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"\].keys() // iterator 0,
> 1, 2

### Binary and octal literals

> ECMAScript 6 introduced binary and octal literal notations, for binary
> (b) and octal (o). Both these notations are a little similar to
> hexadecimal literal notation for prepending 0x or 0X to a value.
>
> The new octal literal format begins with 0o or 0O, while the new
> binary literal format begins with 0b or 0B. Each literal type must be
> followed by one or more digits; 0-7 for octal and 0-1 for binary.
> Here\'s an example:
>
> // ECMAScript 6
>
> varvalue11 = 0o65; // 53 in decimal varvalue22 = 0b100; // 4 in
> decimal
>
> 0b111110111 === 503 // will return true 0o767 === 503 // will return
> true

### Reflect API

> The reflect object is a single object that contains functions related
> to the reflection API. As the name suggests, it is merely a reflection
> of the objects so that one can observe them closely, regardless of who
> the object was created by. The reflect object is not a function
> object. It does not have a constructor method. It cannot be invoked as
> a function, because it does not have a call method.
>
> Reflect API is known to be the inverse of Proxy API.
>
> Here is a list of methods a reflect object has.

#### Reflect.get(target, prop, \[receiver\])

> *Chapter 11*
>
> This method allows you to get the property of an object. This method
> is similar to property accessors syntax (object\[propertyKey\]).

##### Returns

> The reflect object returns the value of property.

##### Parameter

> The parameters are target objects on which to get property, the name
> of property, and the value.

##### Description

> The static Reflect.get() method works like getting a property from an
> object (target\[propertyKey\]) as a function.
>
> An example of the get method is as follows:
>
> // Object varobject={a:4,b:5}; Reflect.get(object,\"b\");// 5
>
> // Array
>
> Reflect.get(\[\"first\",\"second\"\],1);// \"second\", since array
> starts with 0 index
>
> // Proxy with a get handler var x ={p:9}; varobject=newProxy(x, {
>
> get(a,b,c){returnb +\"meow\";}
>
> });
>
> Reflect.get(object,\"woof\");// \"woofbar\"

#### Reflect.set(target, prop, value, \[receiver\])

> This method allows you to set a property of an object. This method is
> also similar to property accessor syntax.

##### Returns

> The Reflect.set(target, prop, value, \[receiver\] returns a Boolean
> value indicating whether property was successful or not.
>
> []{#_bookmark527 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript
> 6]{.underline}*

##### Parameter

> Parameters are target objects, name of the property, the value to set,
> and the receiver.

##### Description

> The static Reflect.set() strategy works like setting a property on an
> item. An example of this method is shown here:
>
> // Object varobject={};
>
> Reflect.set(object,\"property\",\"value\");// will return true
> object.property;// \"value\"
>
> // Array vararr=\[\"cow\",\"cow\",\"cow\"\];
>
> Reflect.set(arr,1,\"goat\");// will return true arr\[1\];// \"goat\"
>
> // It can truncate an array. Reflect.set(arr,\"length\",1);// will
> return true arr;// \[\"goat\"\];
>
> // With just one argument, propertyKey and value are \"undefined\".
> varobject={};
>
> Reflect.set(object);// will return true
> Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(object,\"undefined\");
>
> // { value: undefined, writable: true, enumerable: true, configurable:
> true }

#### Reflect.has(target, prop)

> This method allows you to check whether an object holds a specific
> property. This
>
> method is similar to the in operator.

##### Returns

> The Reflect.has(target, prop) returns a Boolean value indicating
> whether the target has a property or not.

##### Parameter

> The target object and the property key (name of property to check) is
> passed.

[]{#_bookmark528 .anchor}*Chapter 11*

##### Description

> The static Reflect.has() technique works like the in operator as a
> function. An example of this method is shown here:
>
> Reflect.has({a:0},\"a\");// will return true
> Reflect.has({a:0},\"b\");// will return false
>
> // returns true for properties in the prototype chain
> Reflect.has({a:0},\"toString\");
>
> // Proxy with .has() handler method object=newProxy({}, {
>
> has(s,d){returns.startsWith(\"cat\");}
>
> });
>
> Reflect.has(object,\"catastrophe\");// will return true
> Reflect.has(object,\"camel\");// will return false

#### Reflect.apply(target, receiver, args)

> This method is used to call a target function with a specified set of
> arguments.

##### Returns

> The Reflect.apply(target, receiver, args) method returns nothing.

##### Parameter

> Target function to call. thisArgument and ArgumentList is passed as
> parameters.

##### Description

> The static Reflect.apply() technique calls an objective function with
> specified
>
> arguments.
>
> An example of this method is shown here:
>
> Reflect.apply(Math.floor, undefined,\[3.999\]);
>
> // 3;

> Reflect.apply(\"\".charAt,\"stars\",\[2\]);
>
> // \"a\"

#### Reflect.construct(target, args)

> This method allows you to call a constructor function with multiple
> arguments. It is just like calling new function (...args).

##### Returns

> The Reflect.construct(target, args) returns nothing.

##### Parameter

> The target function to be called, an argument list, and the new target
> (constructor to be used) are parameters.

##### Description

> The Reflect.construct method permits you to conjure a constructor with
> a variable number of contentions (which would likewise be conceivable
> utilizing the spread operator consolidated with the new operator).
>
> An example of this method is shown here:
>
> Using Reflect.construct():
>
> var d =Reflect.construct(Date,\[2015,1,5\]); dinstanceofDate;// will
> return true d.getFullYear();// 2015
>
> Using newTarget:
>
> functionmyConstructor(){}
>
> var result =Reflect.construct(Array,\[\],myConstructor);
>
> Reflect.getPrototypeOf(result);// myConstructor.prototype
> Array.isArray(result);// will return true

#### Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(target, prop)

> This method is just like Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(). This
> method returns a property descriptor of a specific property if it
> exists on an object; otherwise, undefined is returned. The only
> difference between these two is the way non-object targets are
> handled.

##### Returns

> The Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(target, prop) method returns a
> property descriptor object.

##### Parameter

> *Chapter 11*
>
> The target object in which to look for property, and property key
> (name of the property to be applied) are the parameters.

##### Description

> The Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor system gives back a property
> descriptor of the given property in the event that it exists on the
> object, indistinct something else undefined is returned if property
> does not exists. The main contrast to
> Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() is the manner by which non-object
> targets are taken care of.
>
> An example of this method is shown here:
>
> Using Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor():
>
> Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor({a:\"bye\"},\"a\");
>
> // {value: \"bye\", writable: true, enumerable: true, configurable:
> true}
>
> Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor({x:\"bye\"},\"y\");
>
> // undefined
>
> Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(\[\],\"length\");
>
> // {value: 0, writable: true, enumerable: false, configurable: false}
>
> Difference to Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor():
>
> If the first argument to this method is not an object (a primitive),
> then it will cause a TypeError. With Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor,
> a non-object first argument will be coerced to an object at first:
>
> Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(\"woof\",0);
>
> // TypeError: \"woof\" is not non-null object
>
> Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(\"dummy\",0);
>
> // { value: \"d\", writable: false, enumerable: true, configurable:
> false }

#### Reflect.defineProperty(target, prop, desc)

> This method is similar toObject.defineProperty(). This method allows
> us to modify the property of an object. The Object.defineProperty()
> method returns an object or returns a type error if the property is
> not defined successfully. The Reflect.defineProperty() method returns
> true if the property was defined successfully. Otherwise, it returns
> false.
>
> []{#_bookmark531 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript
> 6]{.underline}*

##### Returns

> The Reflect.defineProperty(target, prop, desc) method returns a
> Boolean demonstrating regardless of whether the property was
> effectively characterized.

##### Parameter

> Target object, property key, and attributes are the parameters.

##### Description

> The Reflect.defineProperty technique permits the exact expansion to or
> change of a property on an object. For more subtle elements, see the
> Object. defineProperty, which is comparative. Object.defineProperty
> gives back the objects or tosses TypeError if the property has not
> been effectively characterized. Reflect.defineProperty, then again,

> [http://haseeb.deeurl.com/client-demos/everydayadvice/v3/={};](http://haseeb.deeurl.com/client-demos/everydayadvice/v3/%3D)
> Reflect.defineProperty(object,\"x\",{value:7});// will return true
> object.x;// 7
>
> Checking if property definition has been successful:
>
> With Object.defineProperty, which returns an object if successful or
> throws a TypeError otherwise, you would use a try\...catch block to
> catch any error that occurred while defining a property. As
> Reflect.defineProperty returns a Boolean success status, you can just

#### Reflect.getPrototypeOf(target)

> This method returns a prototype of the specified object. It is similar
> to the Object. getPrototypeOf() method.

##### Returns

> The Reflect.getPrototypeOf(target) method returns the prototype of
> object or null.

[]{#_bookmark532 .anchor}*Chapter 11*

##### Parameter

> The target object for which we need the prototype is passed as a
> parameter.

##### Description

> The static Reflect.getPrototypeOf() method is the same technique as
> Object. getPrototypeOf(). It gives back the model (that is, the
> estimation of the inside \[\[Prototype\]\] property) of the
> predetermined item.
>
> An example of this method is shown here:
>
> Reflect.getPrototypeOf({});// Object.prototype
> Reflect.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype);// will return null
> Reflect.getPrototypeOf(Object.create(null));// will return null

#### Reflect.setPrototypeOf(target, newProto)

> This method sets the prototype of object to another object or to null.
> This method is the same as the Object.setPrototypeOf() method.

##### Returns

> The Reflect.setPrototypeOf(target, newProto) method returns a Boolean
> showing regardless of whether the model was effectively set.

##### Parameter

#### Reflect.deleteProperty(target, prop)

> This method is used to delete properties from an object. This method
> is similar to the delete operator as a function.

##### Returns

> The Reflect.deleteProperty(target, prop) method returns a Boolean
> value telling us whether the property is deleted or not.

##### Parameter

> The target object and the name of the property to be deleted are
> parameters.

##### Description

> The Reflect.deleteProperty method permits you to erase a property on
> an object. It returns boolean value indicating if the property was
> successfully removed or not, regardless of whether the property was
> effectively characterized. It is almost similar to the non-strict
> delete operator.
>
> An example of this method is shown here:
>
> varobject={a:11,b:12}; Reflect.deleteProperty(object,\"a\");// will
> return true object;// { y: 12 }
>
> vararr=\[11,12,13,14,15\];
>
> Reflect.deleteProperty(arr,\"3\");// will return true arr;// \[11, 12,
> 13, , 15\]
>
> // Returns true if no such property exists
> Reflect.deleteProperty({},\"bar\");// will return true
>
> // Returns false if a property is unconfigurable
> Reflect.deleteProperty(Object.freeze({bar:1}),\"bar\");// will return
> false

#### Reflect.enumerate(target)

> This method returns an iterator with enumerable own and inherited
> properties of the target object.

##### Returns

> Returns an iterator with the enumerable own and acquired properties of
> the objective object.

[]{#_bookmark534 .anchor}*Chapter 11*

##### Parameter

> Target object on which to get property is passed in the function.

##### Description

> The Reflect.enumerate() method returns an iterator with the enumerable
> own and inherited properties of the target object.
>
> An example of this method is shown here:
>
> varobject={a:98,b:99};
>
> for(var name ofReflect.enumerate(object)) { console.log(name);
>
> }
>
> // logs \"a\" and \"b\"

#### Reflect.preventExtensions(target)

> This is the same method as Object.preventExtensions(). It prevents us
> from adding more properties (extensions) to an object.

##### Returns

> Returns a Boolean demonstrating regardless of whether the objective
> was effectively set to forestall expansions.

##### Parameter

> Target object on which we have to prevent extensions.

##### Description

> The static Reflect.preventExtensions() method keeps new properties
> from always being added to an object (that is, counteracts future
> augmentations to the item). It is like Object.preventExtensions(), yet
> with a few contrasts.
>
> An example of this method is as follows:
>
> varblank={};
>
> Reflect.isExtensible(blank);// === will return true
>
> Reflect.preventExtensions(blank); Reflect.isExtensible(blank);// ===
> will return false
>
> []{#_bookmark535 .anchor}*[Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript
> 6]{.underline}*

#### Reflect.isExtensible(target)

> This method allows us to check whether new properties can be added to
> an object or whether the object is extensible or not. This method is
> similar to the Object. isExtensible() method.

##### Returns

> A Boolean value indicating whether the target is extensible or not.

##### Parameter

> The target object that has to be checked for its extensibility.

##### Description

> The static Reflect.isExtensible() technique figures out whether an
> item is extensible (whether it can have new properties added to it).
> It is like Object. isExtensible(), yet with a few contrasts.
>
> An example of this method is shown here:
>
> var blank ={}; Reflect.isExtensible(blank);
>
> The preceding function will return true.

#### Reflect.ownKeys(target)

> This method returns the object\'s own property keys.

##### Returns

> The Reflect.ownKeys(target) method returns an array of target objects.

##### Parameter

> Target object from where to get keys.

##### Description

> *Chapter 11*
>
> The static Reflect.set() strategy works like setting a property on an
> object. Here is an example of this method:
>
> Reflect.ownKeys({a:5,b:6,c:7}); Reflect.ownKeys(\[\]);
>
> varsymbol=Symbol.for(\"dirt\"); varsymbolb=Symbol.for(\"sky\");
> varobject={\[symbol\]:0,\"string\":0,\"99\":0,\"4\":0,
>
> \[symbolb\]:0,\"100\":0,\"-7\":0,\"second string\":0};
> Reflect.ownKeys(object);

### Tail calls

> Calls in tail position won\'t be able to grow the stack without any
> limits. It helps in making recursive algorithms safe and secure in the
> safe of unbounded inputs.

#### Example

> The following function produces a factorial of any number passed to
> it. There is a tail call in the end of the function which recalls the
> function. Previously, we used to get a stackoverflow error, but ES6 is
> safe for handling arbitrary inputs.
>
> If the output is out of range, it will simply display infinity:
>
> function factorial(n, acc) { \'use strict\';
>
> if (n \<= 1) return acc;
>
> return factorial(n - 1, n \* acc);
>
> }
>
> console.log(factorial(5, 1)); //120
>
> console.log(factorial(200, 1)); //Infinity
>
> // Stack overflow in most implementations today,

# Server-side JavaScript -- NodeJS

> Node.js is a relatively new server platform that is built on
> JavaScript. One of the main features of Node is that it is a
> non-blocking server. This means that resource- intensive tasks will
> not tie up the server. Node.js can then handle many concurrent
> connections. It can also handle real-time communications more easily
> than a blocking server.
>
> One of the main uses of Node.js is as a web server. This is a perfect
> task as serving web pages usually involves reading files and
> connecting to a database. It is able to serve more clients while
> either of these two actions are executing. This is very
>
> different compared to a blocking server. A blocking server would have
> to wait for all the resources to return before it could respond to

> *Chapter 12*
>
> We will start our overview of Node.js with the basics. This will
> include loading modules, managing processes, handling files and paths,
> and **REPL** (**Read Eval Print Loop**). These are things that
> virtually any Node.js project will need.

### Modules {#modules-1}

> Node.js is a modular system. Much of the functionality of Node.js is
> contained in modules that must be loaded at runtime. This makes the
> knowledge of loading and building modules a core requirement to using
> Node. Here are the references you can use for your Node modules:

-   require()

-   modules.export

#### require()

> This loads the module at the given path:
>
> require(path)

##### Return value

> The return value will be an object. The properties of this object will
> vary, depending on what is loaded. We will cover module.exports next,
> which is what module designers and even you can use to set the value
> of this return value.

##### Description

> The require() function is used to load the module at a path, where the
> path can be a core module (a module packaged with Node.js), directory,
> file, or module (a project that you or someone else has built). As a
> result, it is very versatile. The require() function will try to
> resolve the passed-in path in this order: the core module, the
> directory or file if the path begins with \"./\", \"/\", \"../\", and
> then the module, take a look at the following description for more
> information. You then need to check the require function in different
> locations for all of this to work:

-   You will first look for a core module. The core modules can be
    viewed in the source of Node.js under the lib directory. We will
    cover the most prolifically used modules in this chapter.

-   Next, require would load the path as a file if the string begins
    with \"./\" ,\"/\", or \"../\". These are current directory, root
    directory, and parent directory, respectively.

> []{#_bookmark539 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

-   If the filename is not found, require will then try appending .js,
    .json, or .node. This means that the require (./data/models)
    function and require (./data/models,js) will load the same file. If
    require does not find a file, then it will try to load the path as a
    directory. This means it will

> look for either an index.js file or the main property inside
> package.json. Require will then either use index.js or package.json to
> load as a file.

-   Finally, if the path does not start with \"./\", \"/\", or \"../\"
    and it is not a core module, require will search for a node_modules
    folder. The first directory will be the current directory. After
    that, each directory will be a parent directory, all the way up to
    the root directory. In addition to this, require will also search
    the paths in the NODE_PATH environment variable.

> As a quick summary, here is the order that require will use:

-   Core module (no relative path)

-   File module (relative path)

-   Folder module (relative path)

-   The node_modules module (no relative path)

> Here are some examples of how the require function is used to load
> core modules,
>
> files, or modules:
>
> var http = require(\'http\'); //loads a core module
>
> As you can see from the comment, this example will load the HTTP core
> module:
>
> var data = require(\'./data\'); //loads a directory
>
> This example shows you how to load a directory:
>
> var dataModels = require(\'./data/models\'); //loads the file
> models.js
>
> This one will load a file:
>
> var redis = require(\'redis\'); //loads a module
>
> Finally, this one will load a module.
>
> Every Node.js project will use require many times, so knowing how and
> where it will load is important.
>
> Here is a simple example that demonstrates require and how it works
> with
>
> module.exports.

[]{#_bookmark540 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

> Here is the file that will be loaded with require, requireTest.js, and
> it will be loaded from a relative path:
>
> module.exports = \'This value is from requireTest\';
>
> Here is how to load this value in a Node.js script:
>
> var requireTest = require(\'./requireTest\');
> console.log(requireTest);

#### module.exports

> The module.exports property is a convenience property used in a module
> to expose
>
> the functionality of the module outside the scope of the current file.

##### Return value

> The module.exports property is the return value from the module. This
> can seem misleading though. We will not return module.exports. It is
> the object or properties set at module.exports that are available from
> this module.

##### Description

> The module.exports property is the link from the current file into the
> scope of the calling file. Any variables defined in the current file
> will not be in the scope of file that calls it. To make the variables
> available, you must either set them as the value of module.exports or
> as properties of module.exports. This functionality is the mechanism
> that Node.js uses with require. Exports can be set to any type:
> string, integer, function, object, and many others. Functions allow us
> to either pass in values or create a constructor() function. Objects
> can be created and then used to overwrite the exports object or can be
> added to the exports object as properties. We have all of
> JavaScript\'s function- and object-creation tricks at our disposal.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image115.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.33658683289588803in"}A quick note is that require will cache
> output. This means consecutive calls to the same module will return
> the same instance of an object.
>
> []{#_bookmark541 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*
>
> Examples of the constructor() function being used are shown here:

-   This allows an object to be passed in:

> module.exports = function Foo(bar) {do something with bar};

-   This allows the export function to be executed:

> module.exports = function FooConstructor() {};

-   The foo property will be used in the following two examples:

> module.exports = {foo: foo()}; module.exports.foo = foo();

### The OS module

> Here are the most important functions and properties of the os module.
> The os module allows you to get information from the operating system.
> This is important as we may need to know the hostname or how many CPUs
> are currently available.
>
> All the functions that we will look at now assume that var os =
> require(\'os\') is
>
> already in the file.

#### hostname()

> This will return the hostname of the device:
>
> .hostname()

##### Description

> An example of how the os.hostname() function is used is shown here. In
> this case, it will return the hostname of the current computer used.
> It will not return the domain suffix of the computer:
>
> os.hostname();

#### cpus()

> This will return the number of CPUs of the current device:
>
> .cpus()

##### Description

> *Chapter 12*
>
> We will get an array of objects that map to each CPU. The objects will
> have the model, speed, and times:

-   Model and speed are the processor model and speed of the CPU,
    respectively. Note that, most of the time, model and speed will not
    be relevant to our code.

-   Times has the breakdown of how many milliseconds the CPU has spent
    in

> user, nice, sys, idle, and irq.
>
> This information can be used, most of the time, to find out how many
> CPUs the machine has. It is good to know this information, as Node.js
> is single threaded and we can launch multiple processes in a cluster
> for each CPU.
>
> Here is an example of getting the number of CPUs on a computer:
>
> var cpus = os.cpus().length;

#### networkInterfaces()

> This gets a list of network interfaces:
>
> .networkInterfaces()

##### Description

> This will be an object that contains all the network interfaces. Each
> property maps to an interface and it will have an array of all the IP
> addresses (IPv4 and IPv6).
>
> As an example, this is how you can get the object that has all the
> interfaces for a computer:
>
> var network = os.networkInterfaces();

### The process module

> Process is an object that allows us to get access to events on the
> process. We can also get access to stdin, stdout, and stderr. These
> are global objects that will be available in any file or context.
>
> []{#_bookmark543 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

#### stdout

> The stdout object is a writable stream.
>
> stdout

##### Description

> This is the stream that will connect to stdout. Note that streams will
> be covered later in this chapter under Utilites. If we are running
> Node.js as a console application,
>
> this is where we could write to stdout if needed. Most streams in Node
> are non- blocking, but writes to stdout and stderr are blocking.
>
> We also can use stdout to find out whether Node.js is running in TTY.
> We can
>
> access process.stdout.isTTY. This is a Boolean value.
>
> The example here will show us how to write a message to the stdout
> stream. By default, this will be sent to the process.stdout.write
> console. This will write to stdout.

#### stderr

> The stderr object is a writable stream.
>
> stderr

##### Description

> This is similar to stdout, with the key difference being it writes to
> stderr. This is very useful for console applications as we can write
> to the console what is happening.
>
> As an example, this writes to the stderr stream. By default this will
> write to the console.
>
> process.stderr.write(\"Something seems to have gone wrong.\");

#### stdin

> This is a readable stream that maps to stdin.
>
> stdin

##### Description

> *Chapter 12*
>
> This maps to the standard stream, stdin, in the same way stdout and
> stderr map to the stderr streams. The difference is that the stdin
> object is readable, while the others are writable. Anything that is
> piped into this process can be read out using process.stdin. To read
> from a readable stream, we will have to listen for two possible events
> that let us know how we can retrieve data. The first is readable, and
> the other is data. We will cover this more in depth when we get to the
> stream section.
>
> For instance, this example takes the data that is sent in through
> stdin and sends it to
>
> stdout using the readable event:
>
> process.stdin.on(\'readable\', function() { var data =
> process.stdin.read();
>
> if(data !== null) process.stdout.write(data);
>
> });

#### argv

> This is all the command-line arguments passed in:
>
> **argv**

##### Description

> The argv commands will be an array of all the arguments passed into
> this script. Arguments are split by spaces. This means that debug=true
> (which has no spaces) will be one argument, and debug = true (a space
> between each word) will be three. This is an important distinction to
> keep in mind if you want to pass values in
>
> arguments. Arguments 0 and 1 will always be the node and the path and
> filename of
>
> the current script.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> process.argv.forEach(function(val){ if(val === \'debug\'){ debug();
>
> } });

#### Signal events

> Signal events allow you to listen for the standard POSIX signals:
>
> process.on({signal, callback});
>
> []{#_bookmark545 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

##### Description

> All of the POSIX signals, except SIGKILL and SIGSTOP, can be listened
> for. In addition to these signals, you can also listen for some
> Windows signals. Here is the list of signals:

-   SIGUSR1: This is a user-defined signal. In Node.js, it is usually
    used to start the debugger.

-   SIGTERM: This is the signal to terminate.

-   SIGINT: This is the signal to interrupt. It is usually sent by
    pressing *Ctrl* + *C*.

-   SIGPIPE: This lets a process know when it is trying to pipe to a
    nonexistent process.

-   SIGHUP: This is the signal that tells a process that the terminal it
    was running in has hung up.

-   SIGBREAK: This is non-POSIX and is used by Windows. It should be
    used in a manner similar to SIGINT.

-   SIGWINCH: This is the signal to tell the process that the window has
    changed size.

> Here is an example of listening for SIGINT, which recognizes that
> *Ctrl* + *C* was pressed:
>
> process.on(\'SIGINT\', function(){
>
> //ctrl+c was pressed
>
> });

#### process.env

> This object contains the environment variables:
>
> process.env

##### Description

> The process.env object is a simple JavaScript object that contains all
> the environment variables. Each property will be a string.
>
> A great place to put configuration settings is in the environment when
> building an extensible application. The process.env object can then be
> used to check whether the current environment is in production or even
> to just store the configuration settings.

[]{#_bookmark546 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

> Here is an example of checking for environment and setting a value
> from the environment:
>
> if(process.env.NODE_ENV !== \'production\')
>
> //do test stuff
>
> var redisHost = process.env.REDIS_HOST;

#### kill

> This will send a signal event to a process:
>
> process.kill(pid, \[signal\])

##### Description

> This will send any of the signal events that are defined in the signal
> events section,
>
> which that we covered earlier. This is essentially running the POSIX
> kill command.
>
> We can use this kill command to send the current process a signal,
> using
>
> process.pid, or to send another process that we have a reference to
> the kill signal.
>
> Here is an example of killing the specific process ID 4634:
>
> process.kill(4634, \'SIGTERM\');

#### pid

> This gets the current pid:
>
> process.pid

##### Description

> It is the pid (process ID) of the process.
>
> This is an example of process.kill and process.pid used together:
>
> process.kill(process.pid, \'SIGTERM\');

#### cwd

> This gets the current working directory:
>
> process.cwd()
>
> []{#_bookmark547 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*
>
> Here is an example that set the cwd variable to the current working
> directory of the process:
>
> var cwd = process.cwd();

### File functions

> This section is not a true module, like the previous section on
> process. This section will focus on any of the functions or modules
> that allow us to read, write, or find files and directories.

####  filename

> This returns a string of the current filename:
>
> **filename**

##### Description

> The filename command returns the current filename. This can be
> different, depending on which file is being executed. A module that is
> being executed will return its filename instead of the main entry
> point.
>
> Here is an example of logging the current filename to the console:
>
> **console.log( filename);**

####  dirname

> This is a string of the current directory:
>
> **dirname**

##### Description

> Much like filename, this will return the currently executing file\'s
> directory. The
>
> dirname command is used many times when a relative path needs to be
> created.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image116.png){width="0.41783792650918633in"
> height="0.3365824584426947in"}Both the filename and dirname variables
> are available in any file being executed by Node.js. They are
> determined per file, so they are correct for each file that gets
> executed.
>
> This example assumes Express has been loaded as express:
>
> //express is loaded
>
> app.use(express.static( dirname + \'/static\'));

#### The file module

> *Chapter 12*
>
> We will now look at a list of key functions in the file module. All of
> these functions
>
> just run the underlying POSIX commands.
>
> Each of the commands we cover will have an asynchronous and
> synchronous version of each function. The synchronous function will be
> the same name, with Sync appended, for example, open and openSync. In
> a way, the asynchronous versions
>
> are more like Node.js, in that, they let the event loop process
> without holding up execution.
>
> Each asynchronous function will need a callback function defined as
> the last parameter. This function will be in the form of function(err,
> result). We will cover this when we get to handling errors. The quick
> takeaway is that the first parameter, err, will be null if no error
> occurred, or it will have the error.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image117.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.336576990376203in"}In the current versions of Node.js, you
> need not use a callback function, but this will become an exception in
> v0.12.
>
> The synchronous functions will not process anything in the event loop
> until the function returns. While this seems against the Node.js
> non-blocking paradigm, it makes sense in certain cases, for example,
> when a specific file must be opened before anything else can process.
> This means that the classic try/catch is needed to handle any
> exceptions or errors.
>
> In almost every circumstance, the asynchronous version is the one that
> should be used.
>
> Each example is under the assumption that the fs variable already
> exists. Here is the code that sets the fs variable to the fs module:
>
> var fs = require(\'fs\');

#### stat

> This returns fs.Stats, which is an object with information about the
> queried file
>
> or directory:
>
> fs.statstat(path, callback) fs.statSync(path)
>
> []{#_bookmark549 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

##### Description

> The stat variable gets the the data that would be returned after
> running stat() on the operating system. The stat object is an instance
> of fs.Stats. This object gives us useful functions such as isFile()
> and isDirectory(). In addition to this, fs.Stats has many properties.
> We can see the modified time, access time, and file size.
>
> There are more functions and properties, but these are the most likely
> used.
>
> The fs.lstat() and fs.fstat() functions will both return an fs.Stats
> object when pointed to a file. The difference is that lstat will run
> against a link instead of following the link to the file or directory.
> The fstat runs against a file descriptor instead of a path.
>
> Here is an example that loads a file named test.txt in the same
> directory as the
>
> code file and logs the fs.Stats object:
>
> fs.stat( dirname + \'\\test.txt\', function(err, stats){
> console.log(stats);
>
> });

#### open

> This returns a file descriptor of the path passed in:
>
> fs.open(path, flags, \[mode\], callback) fs.openSync(path, flags,
> \[mode\])

##### Description

> This will open a file in the path passed in. There are many flags that
> can be passed.
>
> They are described here:

-   r: Read only, errors when file does not exist

-   r+: Read and write, errors when file does not exist

-   rs: Read synchronous, here, \"synchronous\" only refers to the
    filesystem caching data and not synchronous such as openSync

-   rs+: Read and write synchronous

-   w: Write

-   wx: Write, errors when file exists

#### read

> This reads from a file descriptor:

> fs.read(fd, buffer, offset, length, position, callback)
> fs.readSync(fd, buffer, offset, length, position)

##### Description

> The read() function takes a lot of parameters to run. We need a file

#### readFile

> This is a simplified version for reading a file:
>
> fs.readFile(filename, \[options\], callback) fs.readFileSync(filename,
> \[options\])

##### Description

> The readFile() function greatly simplifies the process of reading a
> file in Node.js. In the previous function, fs.read, we needed to set
> everything up before we tried to read the file. The readFile()
> function allows us to just pass a filename and get a buffer back of
> what is in the file.
>
> The optional options object takes a flag and an encoding property. The
> flag property is the same as the flag from fs.open, so any of them can
> be used. The encoding is used for the buffer that is returned in the
> callback.
>
> Here is an example that demonstrates how much easier it is to load a
> file with
>
> readFile. The example is also using the optional options parameter:
>
> var filename = dirname + \'/test.txt\';
>
> fs.readFile(filename, {flag: \'r\', encoding: \'utf8\'}, function(err,
> data){
>
> console.log(data.toString(\'utf8\'));
>
> });

#### close

> This will close a file descriptor:
>
> fs.close(fd, callback) fs.closeSync(fd)

##### Description

> It is important to close any files that we open in our scripts. If we
> get a file descriptor
>
> from fs.open, we will need to call fs.close on that file descriptor at
> some point. This is an example of closing a file descriptor:
>
> fs.close(fd, function(err){
>
> //handle err here
>
> });

[]{#_bookmark552 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

#### write

> This writes to a file descriptor:
>
> fs.write(fd, buffer, offset, length, position, callback)
> fs.writeSync(fd, buffer, offset, length, position)

##### Description

> The write() function takes a file descriptor and buffer to write to a
> file. Much like
>
> read, we have to pass in quite a few parameters to make this work.
>
> In the following example, we are reading a file into a buffer and then
> writing that buffer back out to another file. The offset and length
> are both integers that we need to pass in. The position can be an
> integer, but it can also be null. Null will start writing at the
> current position in the file.
>
> Just like read, write can be complex. Here is a full example of
> reading from one file
>
> and writing to another:
>
> var fs = require(\'fs\');
>
> var filename = dirname + \'/test.txt\'; var writeFile = dirname +
> \'/test2.txt\';
>
> fs.stat(filename, function(error, stats) { fs.open(filename, \'r\',
> function(err, fd) {
>
> var buffer = new Buffer(stats.size);

> fs.read(fd, buffer, 0, stats.size, null, function(err, bytesRead,
> buffer) {
>
> fs.open(writeFile, \'w\', function(err, writeFD) {
>
> //will create a file named test2.txt with the contents from test.txt
>
> fs.write(writeFD, buffer, 0, buffer.length, null, function(err,

#### writeFile

> This is a simplified function to write to a file:
>
> fs.writeFile(filename, data, \[options\], callback)
> fs.writeFileSync(filename, data, \[options\])

##### Description

> Exactly like the difference between read and readFile, writeFile is a
> simplified version of write. We just pass in a filename and a string
> or buffer, and it will write the file.
>
> The callback only returns an error when it occurs.
>
> readFile and writeFile seem like the best choices in most cases, and

});

#### appendFile

> This function allows us to append a file:
>
> fs.appendFile(filename, data, \[options\], callback)
> fs.appendFileSync(filename, data, \[options\])

##### Description

> *Chapter 12*
>
> appendFile exists because writeFile will only write an entire file.
> So, we need another function to add to a file. This is where giving up
> some control for ease comes in. If we were using a file descriptor and
> write, then we could choose to start writing at the end of the file.
> This is effectively appending the file:
>
> Here is an example of appendFile:
>
> var filename = dirname + \'/write.txt\';
>
> var buffer = new Buffer(\'Append this to a file.\', \'utf8\');
> fs.appendFile(filename, buffer, {encoding: \'utf8\', flag: \'w\'},

}

});

### The path module

> The path module is separate from the file module. Path is concerned
> with fixing paths, whereas file is concerned with working with files
> and directories. Many times, these modules will be used together.
>
> The functions covered are the most used and most useful. You will most
> likely need to locate paths relative to your current project, and this
> is what the path module is for:
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image119.png){width="0.4178423009623797in"
> height="0.33658683289588803in"}Note that the path module does not
> check for the existence of path modifications. It essentially only
> makes changes to the string value of a path.
>
> Just like the other modules, the example assumes that the path module
> has been loaded:
>
> var path = require(\'path\');

#### normalize

> This returns a string of the path with any oddities fixed:
>
> path.normalize(pathString)
>
> []{#_bookmark555 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

##### Description

> Normalize will fix many problems associated with reading paths. A
> great example of this is the difference between Windows and Unix
> paths. Unix uses forward slashes, and Windows uses backslashes.
> Normalize will return the correct slashes based on the system it is
> executed on.
>
> In addition to this, normalize will also remove the current directory
> and parent directory shortcuts, (. and .. respectively). It will also
> remove double slashes from a directory. It normalizes any paths passed
> in.
>
> Here is an example of using Unix slashes on a Windows system. This
> example will change all the slashes to backslashes:
>
> var pathString = \"/unix/style/path/separators\";
> console.log(path.normalize(pathString));

#### join

> This returns a string of all the paths joined together:
>
> path.join(\[pathString1\],\[...\])

##### Description

> Join makes it easy to create a path from partial paths. This seems
> like something that can be done with concatenation, but it is easy to
> forget about path separators. Join will make sure that the path
> separators will all be in the correct spots.
>
> Here is an example of join. The example will take all the parameters
> and join them together with the correct slash for your system:
>
> console.log(path.join(\'path\', \'separators\', \'added\'));

#### resolve

> This returns the string of the path based on the parameters:
>
> path.resolve(\[pathString\], \[...\])

##### Description

> This can be viewed as the cd command executed for each parameter. The
> paths passed in can be relative or full paths. A relative path will
> add to the returned path, and a full path will be used whole.

[]{#_bookmark556 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

> Here are two examples:

-   Relative paths, will return /home/josh/test:

> console.log(path.resolve(\'/home/josh/node\', \'..\', \'test\'));

-   A full path will return /home/brian/node:

> console.log(path.resolve(\'/home/josh/node\', \'/home/brian/node\'));

#### relative

> This returns the difference between the to and from paths:
>
> path.relative(from, to)

##### Description

> The path returned can be used with cd to change to the new directory.
>
> Here is an example that will return ../../brian/node, because you must
> go up two parent folders and over to brian/node to get from one to the
> other:
>
> var from = \'/home/josh/node\'; var to = \'/home/brian/node\';
>
> console.log(path.relative(from, to));

#### dirname

> This returns a string of the directory name:
>
> path.dirname(pathString)
>
> This example will return the directory that the current file is in. If
> the file was
>
> in the directory /home/users/jjohanan/node, then the example will
> return
>
> /home/users/jjohanan/node:
>
> console.log(path.dirname( filename));

#### basename

> This returns a string of the final part of a path:
>
> path.basename(pathString, \[ext\])
>
> []{#_bookmark557 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

##### Description

> This will either return the filename or directory depending on what
> path is passed in. The optional ext parameter will remove that portion
> from the return value if it exists.
>
> Here are two examples, one involving a file and the other a directory:

-   This will return test:

> console.log(path.basename(\'/home/josh/test.js\', \'.js\'));

-   This will return josh:

> console.log(path.basename(\'/home/josh\'));

#### extname

> This returns a string of the extension of the path. If there is no
> extension, a blank string is returned:
>
> path.extname(pathString)
>
> Here are two examples:

-   This example will return .js:

> console.log(path.extname(\'/home/josh/test.js\'));

-   This example will return a blank string:

> console.log(path.extname(\'/home/josh\'));

### REPL

> REPL stands for **Read Eval Print Loop**. What this means is that it
> is an interactive console. We can enter in a command (**Read**). The
> command will be executed (**Eval**). The output of the command will
> will be printed to the console (**Print**). Finally, we can do this as
> many times as we want (**Loop**). REPL is great to run a few lines of
> code to see what they will do.

#### node

> This starts Node.js in the REPL mode:
>
> node

##### Description

> *Chapter 12*
>
> The main way REPL will be used is by calling it directly. This can be
> done by executing Node.js without a file to serve, by running just
> node. Once node has returned with a prompt, we can add commands and
> see what happens when we run them. This is perfect to test a few lines
> of code.
>
> Here is a quick example of logging in to the console; first run node
> to get a prompt and then run the command:
>
> node
>
> //wait for \>
>
> console.log(\'hey this REPL!\');

### Handling errors

> Errors are a part of any development project. We must be able to
> handle errors in a graceful way. If we do not, then we are creating
> bad experiences for our users. Even worse, we could be opening up a
> vector for attack. A stack trace that gets sent to an end user can
> give out many details.
>
> This will be a special section that deals more with design patterns
> than with actual code reference. Node.js is an asynchronous
> event-driven platform. For the major part, most people have not worked
> on a platform like this and can make mistakes when handling errors. We
> feel that handling errors is very important.
>
> The core of this information comes from Joyent, one the major forces
> behind Node.js today. You can find more information on Joyent at
> <https://www.joyent.com/developers/node/design/errors>.

#### Types of errors

> Errors can be split into two types: **operational** and **programmer**
> errors. Operational errors are errors that occur during the operation
> of an application. A database server not being accessible is an
> example. These errors can be planned for and handled gracefully.
>
> Next is programmer errors, which are errors in the literal sense. For
> example, a piece of code is malformed or an unexpected condition has
> come up. These are very hard to plan for (if we had planned for them,
> then they wouldn\'t be errors!). These will almost always break the
> server, so we can come back through the logs to find what went wrong.
>
> []{#_bookmark559 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

#### Error design patterns

> Now that we know the two different types of errors, let\'s look at the
> three ways of alerting an application that has an error. The three
> ways are throwing the error, asynchronous callback, and emitting an
> error event:

-   The first pattern of throwing the error is built into JavaScript.
    This pattern is great for any synchronous code. If we are doing any
    synchronous operations and an error occurs, we should throw it. When
    handling a synchronous call, we should wrap the function call in a
    try/catch block. Here is an example with JSON.parse, which runs
    synchronously and throws an error when a non-JSON string is passed
    to it:

> try{
>
> JSON.parse(jsonObject);
>
> } catch (ex) {
>
> //do something with this error
>
> }

-   The next pattern is using an asynchronous callback. Many built-in
    Node functions do this already. The pattern is to use a callback
    that has the signature function(error, result). The first parameter
    will either have an error or be null or undefined. We can implement
    this ourselves whenever we write an asynchronous function. If there
    is an error, return it in the callback as the first parameter.

> ![](./images-ref/media/image120.png){width="0.41784120734908137in"
> height="0.33658683289588803in"}When handling errors like these, we
> must put an error check in every callback function. This is important,
> as not doing this can silently swallow errors.
>
> A good example of this is asynchronous and synchronous filesystem
> module calls. For example, read takes a callback, and readSync should
> be wrapped in a try/catch block.
>
> Here is an example callback and check for error:
>
> fs.read(path, function (err, data) { if(err !== null)
>
> //handle error
>
> })

[]{#_bookmark560 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

> Finally, we can emit an error event. This is used for asynchronous
> functions as well. Whether we implement a callback or event is a
> personal choice, but it should be clear which one is being used. It is
> also a best practice to just implement one. Many times, an event is
> used when there is a long running asynchronous process. Reading data
> from a network socket is an example. A socket does not always give the
> data in one simple pass, so events are set up. One of those events is
> an error event. To handle this, we just need to listen for that event.
> Here is an example of listening for the error event of a socket:
>
> socket.on(\'error\', function(error){
>
> //handle error here
>
> })

## Utilities

> In the next group of modules, we will look at utilities. The functions
> chosen here are used across many different types of applications. We
> will cover everything from events and cryptology to buffers and npm.

### Events

> Events are used in many built-in Node objects. This is because
> emitting and listening for events is the perfect way to let another
> function know when to start executing.
>
> This is especially true in the asynchronous world of Node.js. Anytime
> we use the on function of an object, it means that it has inherited
> from EventEmitter. All of the examples will assume that the events
> variable is already created as follows:
>
> var events = require(\'events\');

#### EventEmitter

> This is the parent class that can be inherited from to create a new
> EventEmitter:
>
> events.EventEmitter

##### Description

> Node.js has a fully featured event system that we can easily inherit
> from and implement. We do not need any extra frameworks or custom
> code. EventEmitter is the class to inherit from, and we will get every
> function in the rest of this section available.
>
> []{#_bookmark561 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*
>
> Here is an example of setting up a custom the EventEmitter parameter:
>
> var util = require(\'util\');
>
> var events = require(\'events\');
>
> function MyEventEmitter(){ events.EventEmitter.call(this); this.test =
> function (emitThis) {
>
> this.emit(\'testEvent\', emitThis);
>
> }
>
> }
>
> util.inherits(MyEventEmitter, events.EventEmitter); var myEE = new
> MyEventEmitter();
>
> myEE.on(\'testEvent\', function (data) { console.log(data) });
> myEE.test(\'test\');

#### on

> This function adds a listener for a specific event:
>
> emitter.on(event, listenerFunction) emitter.addListener(event,
> listenerFunction)

##### Description

> The on function has become the preferred naming convention to add
> listeners to events. As an example, jQuery uses the exact same
> function name for their event listeners. The event handler is a string
> name of the event that will be emitted. The listenerFunction parameter
> is what will be executed when the event is emitted.
>
> The listenerFunction parameter can be an anonymous function or a
> reference to a function. The preferred way of adding a listener is
> with a reference to a function. This will allow us to remove this
> specific listener at a later time.
>
> Here is an example based on our new MyEventEmitter class:
>
> var quickLog = function (data) { console.log(\'quickLog: \' + data);
>
> }
>
> myEE.on(\'testEvent\', quickLog);

#### once

> *Chapter 12*
>
> This works just like on, except it only executes once and then removes
> itself as a listener:
>
> emitter.once(event, listenerFunction)

#### removeListener

> This is the function that is used to remove a listener from an event:
>
> emitter.removeListener(event, function)

##### Description

> When we are done listening for this event, we will want to remove our
> listener. This will help prevent memory leaks. If we added an
> anonymous function as the listener, then we cannot remove it as we do
> not have a reference to it. Using our previous example from on, we
> will remove the listener:
>
> myEE.removeListener(\'testEvent\', quickLog);

#### removeAllListeners

> This function will remove every listener for all events or a specific
> event:
>
> emitter.removeAllListeners(\[event\])

##### Description

> This is essentially the nuclear option to remove listeners. This is
> indiscriminate with listeners. The removeAllListeners parameter will
> even remove listeners we did not add. Use this as a last resort.
>
> An example that removes all the listeners from this event is shown
> here. If the event was left blank, it would remove all listeners for
> all events:
>
> myEE.removeAllListeners(\'testEvent\');

#### setMaxListeners

> This function sets the number of listeners before Node.js and warns
> about a possible memory leak:
>
> emitter.setMaxListeners(numberOfListeners)
>
> []{#_bookmark563 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*
>
> Node.js has a helpful warning when the number of listeners exceeds a
> threshold. The default value is 10, so when you add the eleventh
> listener, Node.js will warn:
>
> (node) warning: possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11
> listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit.
>
> As a general rule, this is true. If we keep adding listeners to an
> event, there is a great chance for a memory leak. However, there will
> be times when we will need more than 10 listeners on an event. This is
> where we use setMaxListeners. If we set the max listeners to zero,
> then we can add as many as we want.
>
> Here is an example of setting the max listeners to 50:
>
> myEE.setMaxListeners(50);

#### emit

> This is how we fire off an event:
>
> emitter.emit(eventName, \[argument\], \[...\])
>
> If we have extended an object to be an event emitter, then we will
> want to emit some events! This is the function to do that. It will
> execute all the event listeners that have attached themselves to this
> event based on eventName.
>
> Here is an example that shows a listener being added and then emitting
> an event:
>
> myEE.on(\'testEvent\', function (data) { console.log(data) });
> myEE.emit(\'testEvent\', \'Emit This!\', \'Another Argument!\');

### Crypto

> Every modern application needs cryptography. A great example of
> Node.js using cryptography is with HTTPS. We will not explore the
> inner workings of HTTPS as there is a module (the https module) that
> does this for us. We will look at the cryptographic functions used to
> hash, store, and check passwords.
>
> In the same way as the other modules, we will require the crypto
> module and have it available for use in our examples. Here is what we
> will need:
>
> var crypto = require(\'crypto\');

#### createHash

> This function will return a crypto.Hash object:
>
> crypto.createHash(algorithm)

[]{#_bookmark564 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

##### Description

> The algorithms that can be used will be different for each system as
> it relies on OpenSSL. We can find out the algorithms that crypto can
> use by calling crypto.getHashes(). This will return an array of
> strings that can then be passed into createHash as the algorithm.
>
> The return object from this function is a crypto.Hash object, which is
> covered in the next section.
>
> Here is an example that creates an MD5 hash:
>
> var md5 = crypto.createHash(\'md5\');

#### The hash object

> This is the object that is returned from crypto.createHash:
>
> hash.update(data, \[encoding\]) hash.digest(\[encoding\])

##### Description

> Once we get a reference to the Hash object that has been returned, you
> will see that it has two functions. The first is update, which allows
> us to add to the data that will be hashed. This can be called multiple
> times. This is important if we want to hash a stream input.
>
> The next function is digest. This will return digest based on the
> algorithm the hash object was created with. The string encoding for
> this function can be hex, binary, or BASE64.
>
> Here is a full example of reading data from a file and then
> calculating the MD5 hash of the file.
>
> var f = file.readFileSync( dirname + \'/test.txt\');
>
> var md5 = crypto.createHash(\'md5\'); md5.update(f);
> console.log(md5.digest(\'base64\'));
>

> height="0.3996522309711286in"}Do not use hashing for passwords. The
> next function we will cover is much more secure than a simple hash. A
> digest hash is great for checking if some data has changed, as the

#### pbkdf2

> This function will use HMAC-SHA1 multiple times to create a derived
> key:
>
> crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations, keyLength, callback)
> crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, salt, iterations, keyLength)

##### Return Type

> Both pbkdf2 and pbkdf2Sync will return a derived key as a buffer.

##### Description

> **Pbkdf2** (**password-based key derivation function 2**) is designed
> for password storage. It is better than hashing because it is
> difficult. Hashing is designed to be a quick calculation. This is bad
> because modern CPUs can calculate thousands upon thousands of hashes a
> second. This makes cracking a hashed password easy.
>
> Pbkdf2 fixes this using a work factor in iterations. The higher the
> iterations, the longer the calculation will take. Now, instead of
> calculating thousands a second, we can slow a CPU down to just a few a
> second. This is a significant decrease.
>
> These are the parameters used:

-   password: This is the string we want to create a derived key for.

-   salt: This is a string that is combined with the password. Doing
    this ensures that the same password will not have the same hash if
    salt is different.

-   iterations: This is the work factor that instructs the function how
    many times to repeat. This can be increased as CPUs become faster.
    Currently, at least 10,000 should create a reasonably secure derived
    key.

-   keyLength: This is the desired length of the returned derived key.
    Here is an example of creating a derived key for the string password
    and salt:

> crypto.pbkdf2(\'password\', \'salt\', 10000, 32, function (err, key) {
> console.log(key.toString(\'base64\'));
>
> });

#### randomBytes

> This returns cryptographically strong pseudo-random data:
>
> crypto.randomBytes(length, \[callback\])

[]{#_bookmark566 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

##### Return type

> A buffer is returned.

> Random data is needed for various functions. While no data can truly
> be random, there are varying levels of randomness. The randomBytes
> parameter is random enough to use for cryptographic functions. A
> perfect use of randomBytes is for a salt to be used in pbkdf2. The
> salt variable is combined with the password to create a different hash
> even if the passwords are the same.
>
> This function can be executed asynchronously or synchronously. It
> depends on whether there is a callback, which it would then execute
> asynchronously.
>
> Here is a function to create a random salt for pbkdf2. If you compare
> this example to the previous one, you will see that this example
> outputs a unique string each time, while the previous one does not:
>
> var random = crypto.randomBytes(256);
>
> crypto.pbkdf2(\'password\', random.toString(\'base64\'), 10000, 32,
> function (err, key) {
>
> console.log(key.toString(\'base64\'));
>
> });

#### pseudoRandomBytes

> This returns pseudo-random data:
>
> crypto.pseudoRandomBytes(length, \[calback\])
> crypto.pseudoRandomBytes(length)

##### Return Type

> A buffer is returned.

##### Description

> This functions exactly like randomBytes, except it is not
> cryptographically strong. This means that we should not use it with
> any cryptographic functions such as pbkdf2.
>
> We can use it for anything else that requires randomness, a filename,
> or a cache key
>
> for example.
>
> []{#_bookmark567 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --

> Here is a simple example of executing this function asynchronously:
>
> crypto.pseudoRandomBytes(256, function (err, randomData) {
> console.log(randomData.toString(\'base64\'));
>
> });

### Buffer

> Node.js uses buffers internally for many things. We have seen this as
> we have had buffers returned for many functions. This is because
> anytime raw data or binary data needs to be stored, it will be stored
> in a buffer.
>
> Buffers have a few quirks about them that we must keep in mind. First,
> buffers store data, but to utilize the data held inside them, we must
> encode it. We will cover the encodings and how to do this in this
> section. Second, buffers cannot be resized. When they are created, we
> must give a length, and that will always be the length of that buffer.
> We can, of course, create a new buffer that is larger
>
> and then copy over the data. Finally, a buffer is a global. We do not
> need to have
>
> var buffer = require(\'buffer\'). Also, it can be utilized in any file
> at any time.

#### Buffer creation

> The initialization function of a buffer is as shown in the following
> code snippet:
>
> new Buffer(size) new Buffer(array)
>
> new Buffer(str, \[encoding\])

##### Return value

> This returns a buffer object.

##### Description

> There are three different ways to initialize a buffer. The first
> function uses an integer of the given size, the next one uses an
> array, and the final method can use just a string. The encoding is
> optional, as it defaults to UFT8.
>
> This example demonstrates initializing using an array with the hello
> string in ASCII:
>
> var hello = \[72, 101, 108, 108, 111\];
>
> var buffer = new Buffer(hello);
> console.log(buffer.toString(\'ascii\'));

[]{#_bookmark568 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

#### index

> This gets the value at the specific index in the buffer:
>
> buffer\[index\]

##### Return Value

> This returns the value at the index.

##### Description

> This works much like an array. Here is an example of getting the first
> index in the
>
> buffer:
>
> var buffer = new Buffer(\'Hello!\'); console.log(buffer\[0\]);

#### toString

> This returns the buffer as a string based on the encoding:
>
> buffer.toString(\[encoding\], \[start\], \[end\])

##### Return Value

> This returns a string.

##### Description

> This is most likely the function that you will use to get the data out
> of a buffer. The
>
> first parameter is encoding, which is one of the following:

-   ASCII

-   UTF8

-   UTF16LE

-   BASE64

-   Binary

-   Hex

> All the parameters are optional, so this means that they all have
> default values. Encoding is defaulted to UTF8, start is 0, and end is
> the end of the buffer.
>
> []{#_bookmark569 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*
>
> Here is an example of creating a buffer and retrieving the data out of
> it. It explicitly
>
> defines each of the parameters:
>
> var buffer = new Buffer(\'Hello this is a buffer\');
> console.log(buffer.toString(\'utf8\', 0, buffer.length));

#### toJSON

> This returns the contents of the buffer as a JavaScript object:
>
> buffer.toJSON()

##### Return Value

> This returns an array with the contents of the buffer.

##### Description

> This will return contents of the buffer mapped to an array. This
> example is similar to the previous example, but with toJSON:
>
> var buffer = new Buffer(\'Hello this is a buffer\');
> console.log(buffer.toJSON());

#### isBuffer

> This is a class method that will determine whether an object is a
> buffer:
>
> Buffer.isBuffer(objectToTest)

##### Return Value

> This returns a Boolean value.

##### Description

> Remember that this is a class method, so it can be executed without a
> new instance of buffer. Here is an example of using the function:
>
> var buffer = new Buffer(\'Hello this is a buffer\');
> console.log(Buffer.isBuffer(buffer));

#### write

> The following code writes to the buffer.
>
> buffer.write(stringToWrite, \[offset\], \[length\], \[encoding\])

[]{#_bookmark570 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

##### Return value

> This returns an integer of the number of bytes written.

##### Description

> This function will write the string passed into the buffer. Much like
> the other buffer functions, there are many optional parameters that
> have defaults. The default offset is 0, the length is buffer.length --
> offset, and the encoding is UTF8.
>
> This example writes to a buffer twice using the return value from the
> first write to
>
> append the second string:
>
> var buffer = new Buffer(12);
>
> var written = buffer.write(\'Buffer \', 0, 7, \'utf8\');
> console.log(written);
>
> buffer.write(\'time.\', written); console.log(buffer.toString());

#### byteLength

> This function will get the length of a string in bytes based on the
> encoding:
>
> buffer.byteLength(string, \[encoding\])

##### Return value

> This returns an integer of the number of bytes needed.

##### Description

> Buffers cannot be resized after initializing, so we may need to know
> how big a string is beforehand. This is where byteLength comes in.
>
> Here is an example that determines the size of a string and then
> writes it to the buffer:
>
> var byteLength = Buffer.byteLength(\'Buffer time.\', \'utf8\'); var
> buffer = new Buffer(byteLength);
>
> var written = buffer.write(\'Buffer time.\', 0, buffer.length,
> \'utf8\'); console.log(buffer.toString());
>
> []{#_bookmark571 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --

#### readUInt

> This will get an unsigned integer at a certain spot in the buffer:
>
> buffer.readUInt8(offset, \[noAssert\]) buffer.readUInt16LE(offset,
> \[noAssert\]) buffer.readUInt16BE(offset, \[noAssert\])
> buffer.readUInt32LE(offset, \[noAssert\]) buffer.readUInt32BE(offset,
> \[noAssert\])

##### Return Value

> This returns an unsigned integer of the size used, 8 for readUInt8.

##### Description

> Not all data stored in a buffer is exactly a byte. Sometimes, data
> will need to be read in 16-bit or 32-bit chunks. In addition to this,
> you can also specify whether the data is little endian or big endian,
> denoted by LE or BE in the function name, respectively.
>
> The offset is which spot in the buffer to start at. The noAssert
> parameter will run validation if the offset size is in the buffer. By
> default, it is false.
>
> Here is an example of setting data and then reading the data out with
> readUInt16:
>
> var buffer = new Buffer(2); buffer\[0\] = 0x1;
>
> buffer\[1\] = 0x2; console.log(buffer.readUInt16LE(0));
> console.log(buffer.readUInt16BE(0));

#### writeUInt

> This writes an unsigned integer to a buffer:
>
> buffer.writeUInt8(value, offset, \[noAssert\])
> buffer.writeUInt16LE(value, offset, \[noAssert\])
> buffer.writeUInt16BE(value, offset, \[noAssert\])
> buffer.writeUInt32LE(value, offset, \[noAssert\])
> buffer.writeUInt32BE(value, offset, \[noAssert\])

##### Description

> This is the exact opposite of the readUInt function. Sometimes, we
> need to write data that is larger than one byte in length. These
> functions make it simple.

[]{#_bookmark572 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

> The noAssert parameter is optional, and it defaults to false. This
> will not run any validation on the value or offset.
>
> Here is an example of writing UInt16 to the buffer:
>
> var buffer = new Buffer(4); buffer.writeUInt16LE(0x0001, 0);
>
> buffer.writeUInt16LE(0x0002, 2); console.log(buffer);
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image122.png){width="0.4144608486439195in"
> height="0.5177012248468942in"}Note that there are more read and write
> functions of this type for the buffer class. Instead of creating a
> very redundant section, I will list them. Remember that they work in
> the same fashion as the functions we have covered: readInt8,
> readInt16LE, readInt16BE, readInt32LE, readInt32BE, readDoubleLE,
> readDoubleBE, readFloatLE, and readFloatBE. There is a write()
> function that maps to each one of these as well.

### Console

> This is much like the console that is present in most modern browsers.
> The console essentially maps to stdout and stderr. This isn\'t a
> module, and each function is not very complex, so let\'s jump right
> in.

#### log

> This writes to stdout:
>
> console.log(message, \[...\])

##### Description

> This is probably the most used console function. It is great for
> debugging, and the output can be combined with piping to write to a
> file for a history. The multiple parameters create a string-like
> function.
>
> Here is an example of using multiple parameters:
>
> console.log(\'Multiple parameters in %s\', \'console.log\');

#### dir {#dir-2}

> This is an alias for util.inspect:
>
> console.dir(object)
>
> []{#_bookmark573 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

##### Description

> Many times, the output of console.log and console.dir will be similar.
> However, when trying to look at an object, console.dir should be
> preferred.

#### time and timeEnd

> These two functions are used together to mark the start and end of a
> timer:
>
> console.time(label) console.timeEnd(label)

##### Description

> These two functions will always be used together. The console.time
> parameter will start a timer that can be stopped with console.timeEnd
> by passing the same label. When timeEnd is called, it will log the
> elapsed time between start and end in milliseconds.
>
> Here is an example that uses setTimeout:
>
> console.time(\'simple-timer\'); setTimeout(function () {
>
> console.timeEnd(\'simple-timer\');
>
> }, 500);

#### trace

> This logs to the console and includes a stack trace:
>
> console.trace(message, \[...\])

##### Description

> This works much like console.log. The first parameter can be treated
> like a formatted string, with the other parameters supplying the
> additional input. The main difference is that console.trace will
> include a stack trace when it logs to the console.
>
> Here is a simple example:
>
> console.trace(\'This should be the first line.\');

### npm (Node Package Manager)

> *Chapter 12*
>
> npm is not a Node.js module like. We will look at some of npm\'s
> features and uses, as almost every Node.js project will use npm.
>
> Most modern platforms have a way of grouping together code that serves
> a function or purpose called packages. Node.js uses npm to track,
> update, pin, and install these packages.

#### init

> This initializes a node module by creating package.json in the current
> directory:
>
> npm init

##### Description

> An interactive console session will ask you quite a few questions and
> use the answers to build a package.json file for you. This is a great
> way to kick off a new module. This will not delete your current the
> package.json file or any of the current properties if the package.json
> file exists.

#### package.json

> This is the file that has all the information about your project.

##### Description

> This is not a function or command, but it is the most important file
> in your project. It is what determines all the information about your
> project. Although technically, the only properties needed are name and
> version, there are many properties that can be set. If this file was
> created using npm in it, you will have quite a few already filled out.
> It would be tedious to list out all the possibilities. Here are just a
> few of the most useful: name, version, scripts, dependencies,
> devDependencies, authors, and license.
>
> The npm docs at <https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html> go
> through all the settings their uses.

#### install

> This is the command to install a package:
>
> **npm install**
>
> **npm install \[package\] \[@version\] \[\--save \| \--save-dev\]**
>
> []{#_bookmark575 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

##### Description

> This is the main way to install new packages and their dependencies.
> If npm install is called without any parameters, it will use
> package.json and install all the dependencies.
>
> This command also allows you to install packages by executing it with
> the name of the package. This can be augmented by adding a version. If
> the version is omitted,
>
> it will install the newest version. In addition to this, you can use
> save flags that create
>
> a property in dependencies or devDependcies.
>
> This is not the entire list of what npm install can do, but it is the
> most used list.

#### update

> This will update a package to the newest version:
>
> npm update \[package\]

##### Description

> This command will update all the packages or a specific package to the
> newest
>
> version.

#### shrinkwrap

> This will explicitly define all the dependencies for a project:
>
> npm shrinkwrap

##### Description

> This is different from the basic list of dependencies in package.json.
> Most packages have requirements of their own. When a package is
> installed, npm will go out and find the newest version that matches
> the dependency\'s specified version. This can lead to different
> versions of packages installed when run at different times. This is
> something that most developers want to avoid.
>
> One way to combat this is to run npm shrinkwrap. It will create
>
> npm-shrinkwrap.json. This file will explicitly define the versions
> currently installed recursively for every package installed. This
> ensures that when you run npm install again, you will know what
> package versions will get installed.

[]{#_bookmark576 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

#### run

> This will run an arbitrary command:
>
> **npm run \[script\]**

##### Description

> The package.json file has a property named scripts. This is an object
> that can have a list of commands that can be run by npm. These scripts
> can be anything that runs from the command line.
>
> There are three commands on npm that use these scripts objects. These
> are npm test, npm start, and npm stop. These commands map to test,
> start, and stop the scripts object, respectively.
>
> Here is an example for a scripts object from package.json and the way
> to call it from npm:
>
> **package.json: \"scripts\": {**
>
> **\"hey\": \"echo hey\"**
>
> **}**
>
> **npm run hey**

### Stream

> Stream is an interface that is used by many internal objects. Any time
> data needs to be read or written, it is most likely done through a
> stream. This fits with the Node.js asynchronous paradigm. If we are
> reading a large file from the filesystem, we would create a listener
> to tell us when each chunk of data is ready to be read. This does not
> change if that file is coming from the network, an HTTP request, or
> stdin.
>
> We are only going to cover using a stream, in this book. The stream
> interface can be implemented with your own objects as well.
>
> Streams can be readable, writable, or duplex (both). We will cover
> readable and writable streams separately.

#### Readable

> This is, of course, a stream that we can get data out of. A readable
> stream can be in one of the two different modes, flowing, or
> non-flowing. Which mode it is in depends on which events are listened
> for.
>
> []{#_bookmark577 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*
>
> To put a stream in the flowing mode, you will just have to listen for
> the data event. Conversely, to put a stream in the non-flowing mode,
> you will have to listen for the readable event and then call the
> stream.read() function to retrieve data. The easiest way to understand
> the modes is to think about the data as a lot of chunks. In the
> flowing mode, every time a chunk is ready, the data event will fire,
> and you can read that chunk in the callback of the data event. In the
> non-flowing mode, the chunk will fire a readable event, and then, you
> will have to call read to get the chunk.
>
> Here is a list of events:

-   readable

-   data

-   end

-   close

-   error

> Here are two examples, one that uses flowing and one that uses
> non-flowing:
>
> var fs = require(\'fs\');
>
> var readable = fs.createReadStream(\'test.txt\');
>
> readable.on(\'data\', function (chunk) {
> console.log(chunk.toString());
>
> });
>
> var fs = require(\'fs\'); readable.on(\'readable\', function () {
>
> var chunk;
>
> while (chunk = readable.read()) { console.log(chunk.toString());
>
> }
>
> });

##### read

> Use with a non-flowing readable stream:
>
> readable.read(\[size\])

###### Return value

> This returns either a string, buffer, or null. A string is returned if
> the encoding is set. A buffer is returned if the encoding is not set.
> Finally, null is returned when there is no data in the stream.

###### Description

> *Chapter 12*
>
> This reads from a stream. Most of the time, the optional parameter
> size is not needed
>
> and should be avoided. Only use this with a non-flowing stream. Here
> is a simple example that reads a file:
>
> readable.on(\'readable\', function () { var chunk;
>
> while (chunk = readable.read()) { console.log(chunk.toString());
>
> }
>
> });

##### setEncoding

> This sets the encoding of the stream:
>
> stream.setEncoding(encoding)

###### Description

> By default, a readable stream will output a buffer. This will set the
> encoding of the buffer, so a string is returned.
>
> Here is the opening example with setEncoding used:
>
> readable.setEncoding(\'utf8\'); readable.on(\'readable\', function ()
> {
>
> var chunk;
>
> while (chunk = readable.read()) { console.log(chunk);
>
> }
>
> });

##### resume and pause

> These functions pause and resume a stream:
>
> stream.pause() stream.resume()

###### Description

> Pause will stop a stream from emitting data events. If this is called
> on a non-flowing stream, it will be changed into a flowing stream and
> be paused. Resume will cause the stream to start emitting data events
> again.
>
> []{#_bookmark579 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*
>
> Here is an example that pauses the stream for a few seconds before
> reading it:
>
> readable.pause();
>
> readable.on(\'data\', function (chunk) {
> console.log(chunk.toString());
>
> });
>
> setTimeout(function () { readable.resume();}, 3000);

##### pipe

> This allows you to take the output of a readable stream and send it to
> the input of a writable stream:
>
> readable.pipe(writable, \[options\])

###### Return Value

> This returns the writable stream so that piping can be chained.

###### Description

> This is exactly the same as piping output in a shell.
>
> A great design paradigm is to pipe from a stream to another stream
> that transforms the stream and then pipe that to the output. For
> example, you want to send a file over the network. You would open the
> file as a readable stream, pass it to a duplex stream that would
> compress it, and pipe the output of the compression to a socket.
>
> Here is a simple example of piping output to stdout:
>
> var readable = fs.createReadStream(\'test.txt\');
> readable.pipe(process.stdout);

#### writable

> This is the stream the data goes to. This is a little simpler as there
> are really only two functions that matter: write and end.
>
> Here are the events and details of when they fire:

-   drain: This fires when the internal buffer has written all the data

-   finish: This fires when the stream has been ended and all the data
    has been written

-   error: This fires when an error occurs

[]{#_bookmark580 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

> ![](./images-ref/media/image123.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.33658683289588803in"}It is important to note that a stream
> can be given more data than it can write in a timely fashion. This is
> especially true when writing to a network stream. Because of this, the
> events finish and drain to let your program know that the data has
> been sent.

##### write

> This function writes to the stream:
>
> writable.write(chunk, \[encoding\], \[callback\])

###### Return value

> This returns a Boolean value if the stream has written completely.

###### Description

> This is the main function of a writable stream. Data can be a buffer
> or string, encoding defaults to UTF8, and the callback is called when
> the current chunk of data has been written.
>
> Here is a simple example:
>
> var fs = require(\'fs\');
>
> var writable = fs.createWriteStream(\'WriteStream.txt\');
>
> var hasWritten = writable.write(\'Write this!\', \'utf8\', function ()
> { console.log(\'The buffer has written\');
>
> });
>
> end
>
> This will close the stream, and no more data can be written:
>
> writable.end(\[chunk\], \[encoding\], \[callback\])

###### Description

> When you are done writing to a stream, the end function should be
> called on it. All the parameters are optional, a chunk is data that
> you can write before the stream ends, encoding will default to UTF8,
> and the callback will be attached to the finish event.
>
> []{#_bookmark581 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --

>
> Here is an example to end a writable stream:

>
> writable.end(\'Last data written.\', \'utf8\', function () {
>
> //this runs when everything has been written.

## The net module

> The net module in Node.js allows us to create network connections. The
> connections that are created will be streams that we can write to and
> read from. This section will focus on just network connections and not
> HTTP. Node.js has a full HTTP module, and we will cover that in the
> next section.
>
> All the functions assume that the net module has been loaded like
> this:
>
> var net = require(\'net\');

### createServer

> This function will create a TCP server:
>
> net.createServer(\[options\], \[listener\])

#### Return value

> This returns a net.Server object.

#### Description

> This function allows us to listen for connections. The returned object
> will be a net.Server object, and the connection listener will be
> passed to a net.Socket object. We will cover both of these objects
> shortly.
>
> Here is a simple example that shows us how to listen and write to a
> socket. Each connection will have to be manually closed:
>
> var net = require(\'net\');
>
> var server = net.createServer(function (connection) {
> connection.write(\'You connected!\');
>
> });
>
> server.listen(5000, function () { console.log(\'Listening on port
> 5000\');
>
> });

### net.Server

> *Chapter 12*
>
> We will now look at the net.Server object. All of the functions in the
> next section will need to a have a Server object created through
> createServer.
>
> The net.Server parameter is an EventEmitter that will emit events.
> Here is a list of the events with the event argument if there is one:

-   Connection: net.Socket

-   close

-   Error: Error

-   listening

> Here is an example that uses all of the events:
>
> var net = require(\'net\');
>
> var server = net.createServer(); server.on(\'listening\', function ()
> {
>
> console.log(\'I am listening\');
>
> });
>
> server.on(\'connection\', function (socket) { console.log(socket);
>
> socket.end(); server.close();
>
> });
>
> server.on(\'error\', function (err) { console.log(err);
>
> });
>
> server.on(\'close\', function () {
>
> console.log(\'The server has stopped listening\');
>
> });
>
> server.listen(5000);

##### listen

> This starts accepting connections:
>
> server.listen(port, \[host\], \[backlog\], \[callback\])

###### Description

> Creating a server does not get it to start listening to requests. We
> will have to give the listen function at least a port. The host is
> optional, as it will listen on all IPv4 addresses, and the backlog
> will be the queue of connections. Finally, the callback will be called
> when the server starts listening.
>
> []{#_bookmark583 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*
>
> You may get EADDRINUSE. This just means that the port is already being
> used by another process.
>
> Here is an example that defines all the parameters:
>
> server.listen(5000, \'127.0.0.1\', 500, function () {
> console.log(\'Listening on port 5000\');
>
> });

##### close

> This closes the current server:
>
> server.close(\[callback\])

###### Description

> This will stop the server from creating new connections. This is
> important to remember because it will not close the current
> connections.
>
> The callback is called when there are no more connections.

##### address

> This gets the port and address:
>
> server.address()

###### Description

> This will give you the port and IP address where this server is
> listening.

##### getConnections

> This gets the number of connections:
>
> server.getConnections(callback)

###### Return Value

> This returns an integer.

###### Description

> This does not give any information on each connection. It only returns
> the number. This is a great way to see whether there are any
> connections. The callback function will need to be in the form of

> **connect**
>
> This easily creates a connection to the specified address:
>
> net.connect(port, \[host\], \[connectListener\])
> net.createConnection(port, \[host\], \[connectListener\])

##### Return value

> This returns a net.Socket object.

##### Description

> This function does not do anything that you cannot do with a socket.
> It is a convenient function that returns a net.Socket object.
>
> For the parameters, a port is required, the host will default to
> localhost, and connectListener will be added to the connect event of

#### net.Socket

> This section will be similar to the net.Server section. The net.Socket
> parameter is the object that is returned anytime a connection is made.
> It can also be used to create a new connection.
>
> It is a readable and writable stream. This is the only way to send and
> receive data from a net.Socket.
>
> Here is the list of events along with details of when they fire:

-   connect: On connection.

-   data: When data is received.

-   end: When the socket has ended.

-   timeout: When the socket has timed out from inactivity. The socket
    is still open at this point.

-   drain: When all the data in the write buffer has been sent.

-   Error: On error.

-   close: When the socket closes.

> As net.Socket is a readable stream, there is no read function. You
> will have to listen for the data event to the get the data.
>
> Here is an example of using a socket to connect to a local server:
>
> var server = net.createServer(); server.on(\'listening\', function ()
> {
>
> console.log(\'I am listening\');
>
> });
>
> server.on(\'connection\', function (socket) { socket.on(\'data\',
> function (d) {
>
> console.log(\'from client: \' + d);
>
> });
>
> });
>
> server.listen(5000);
>
> var client = new net.Socket(); client.on(\'connect\', function () {
>
> setInterval(function () { client.write(\'Hey!\');
>
> }, 1000);
>
> });
>
> client.connect(5000, \'localhost\');

[]{#_bookmark586 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

##### connect

> This creates a connection:
>
> socket.connect(port, \[host\], \[listener\])

###### Description

> This is the function that actually creates a connection. Much like
> net.connection, the port is required, the host will default to
> localhost, and the listener just maps the function to the connection
> event.
>
> Here is an example that connects locally and writes to the connection:
>
> var client = new net.Socket(); client.on(\'connect\', function () {
>
> setInterval(function () { client.write(\'Hey!\');
>
> }, 1000);
>
> });
>
> client.connect(5000, \'localhost\');

##### write

> This sends data out on the socket:
>
> socket.write(data, \[encoding\], \[callback\])

###### Description

> The socket is buffered because it is very easy to queue up more data
> than can be sent over the network. This is done automatically by
> Node.js, but you should be aware of this, as buffering will use up
> memory as it is holding the data to be sent.
>
> The encoding parameter will default to UTF8, but any of the encodings
> we have discussed can be used. The callback will be called once the
> data has been written over the socket.
>
> Here is an example with all of the parameters defined:
>
> var client = new net.Socket(); client.on(\'connect\', function () {
>
> client.write(\'This is the data\', \'utf8\', function(){
> console.log(\'Data has been sent\');
>
> });
>
> });
>
> client.connect(5000, \'localhost\');
>
> []{#_bookmark587 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

##### end

> This starts the closing process of the socket:
>
> socket.end(\[data\], \[encoding\])

###### Description

> This is effectively closing the socket. We cannot say for sure, but
> the reason could be that the server could send some data back,
> although the socket will close shortly.
>
> You can send some data before the socket closes, and this is what the
> optional parameters are for:
>
> Here is an example that closes a socket. var client = new
> net.Socket(); client.on(\'connect\', function () {
>
> client.end(\'I am closing\', \'utf8\');
>
> });
>
> client.connect(5000, \'localhost\');

## The HTTP module

> We will cover the HTTP server module. Technically, you could write
> your HTTP server using the net module, but you do not have to.
>
> Some of these functions are very similar to the net module functions.
> This should make sense as HTTP, at its core, is a network server.
>
> All of these functions and objects are also used with the HTTPS
> module. The only difference is that for the options of createServer
> and https.request, you can pass certificates.
>
> All of the following examples assume that the module has been loaded:
>
> var http = require(\'http\');

### createServer {#createserver-2}

> This creates an HTTP server:
>
> http.createServer(\[requestListener\])

[]{#_bookmark588 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

#### Return Value

> This returns an http.Server object.

#### Description

> Much like net.createServer, this is required to serve anything. The
>
> requestListener parameter is attached to the request event.
>
> Here is a simple example that just logs to the console any time a
> request is made:
>
> var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
> console.log(\'Someone made a request!\'); res.end();
>
> });
>
> server.listen(8080);

### http.Server

> This is the server object that is returned from http.createServer.
> This is the object that will respond to all requests.
>
> We will start with the functions and look at each event separately as
> the events are important to handling requests.

#### listen

> This tells the server to listen on the supplied port, path, or file
> descriptor:
>
> server.listen(port, \[host\], \[callback\]) server.listen(path,
> \[callback\]) server.listen(fd, \[callback\])

##### Description

> Although this function has three different ways to execute, you will
> most likely only use the network listener. In fact, the other two
> listeners are difficult, if not impossible, to even execute on
> Windows. Let\'s cover the last two quickly.
>
> The path listener will use a local socket server, and the file
> descriptor will need a
>
> handle. If this sounds foreign, it means you will use the other
> method.
>
> The network listener requires that the port be used. The host will
> default to localhost if nothing is passed in. In all the functions, a
> callback will be attached to the listening event.
>
> []{#_bookmark589 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*
>
> Here is an example of listening on a network port with all the
> parameters defined:
>
> var server = http.createServer(); server.listen(8080, \'localhost\',
> function(){
>
> console.log(\'The server is listening\');
>
> });

#### close

> This closes the server:
>
> server.close(\[callback\])

##### Description

> This will stop the server from listening. The callback will be
> attached to the close event.
>
> Here is a simple example:
>
> var server = http.createServer(); server.listen(8080, \'localhost\',
> function () {
>
> server.close(function () { console.log(\'Server has closed\');
>
> });
>
> });

#### Events

> The http.Server parameter is an EventEmitter object. The events are
> also where the majority of work will be done.

##### request

> This event fires when a request comes in:
>
> server.on(\'request\', function (req, res) { });

###### Description

> If you only listen to one event, this is the event to listen for. It
> has the request and the server\'s response. The req attribute will be
> http.IncomingMessage, and the res attribute will be
> http.ServerResponse. We will look at both of these objects in this
> section. In addition to this, req implements a readable stream
> interface, and res implements a writable stream interface.

[]{#_bookmark590 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

> Here is an example of listening for a request:
>
> server.on(\'request\', function (req, res) { res.end();
>
> console.log(\'A request was received\');
>
> });

##### close

> This event fires when the server closes:
>
> server.on(\'close\', function () { });

##### upgrade

> This event fires when the client sends an HTTP upgrade:
>
> server.on(\'upgrade\', function (req, socket, buffer) { });

###### Description

> An upgrade request asks the web server to change protocols. If you are
> implementing another protocol other than HTTP you should listen and
> deal with this event. A great example of this is a WebSocket upgrade.
>
> The req attribute is the request, the socket will be a net.Socket, and
> buffer is a Buffer.

### IncomingMessage

> This is the request object when listening for the request event or
> from
>
> http.clientRequest. This is a readable stream.

#### headers

> The HTTP headers from the request:
>
> message.headers

##### Description

> Sometimes, you will want to make decisions based on the information in
> the headers. Here is an example using headers to check for basic
> authentication:
>
> server.on(\'request\', function (req, res) {
>
> if (req.headers.authorization !== undefined)
>
> //do a check here res.end();
>
> });
>
> []{#_bookmark591 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

#### method {#method-2}

> This gets the HTTP method of the request:
>
> message.method

##### Description

> This returns the method as a string in uppercase. Here is an example
> for GET:
>
> server.on(\'request\', function (req, res) { if (req.method ===
> \'GET\')
>
> res.write(req.method); res.end();
>
> });

#### url

> This is the URL that was requested:
>
> message.url

##### Description

> This will be a string of the URL, including any query parameters. You
> can parse the string yourself or use Node\'s query string module and
> use the parse function.
>
> Here is a simple example that will serve any files in the current
> directory. Remember
>
> that this is only an example and does no error checking:
>
> server.on(\'request\', function (req, res) {
>
> var file = fs.createReadStream(\'.\' + req.url); file.pipe(res);
>
> });

#### data

> This is the data event from the readable stream interface.

##### Description

> If you have an incoming message, most likely, you would want to know
> what is in the message. As it is a readable stream, we will need to
> listen for the data event to get all the data out. When the data is
> exhausted, the end event will fire.

[]{#_bookmark592 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

> Here is an example that creates listeners for the data and end event:
>
> var data = \'\';
>
> response.on(\'data\', function (chunk) { console.log(chunk);
>
> data += chunk;
>
> });
>
> response.on(\'end\', function () { console.log(data);
>
> });

### ServerResponse

> This is the response that the HTTP server creates for the event
> request. Each request needs a response, and this is it. This
> implements a writable interface.

#### writeHead

> This will write the HTTP response header:
>
> response.WriteHead(statusCode, \[headers\])

##### Description

> This writes the header for the response. This needs to be called
> before response.write. If it is not, then the server will send it for
> you with the headers you have set.
>
> statusCode is the HTTP status code of the response. A header is an
> object with the name of the header as a property and the value as the
> value.
>
> Here is an example that writes the header:
>
> server.on(\'request\', function (req, res) { res.writeHead(200, {
> \'Content-Type\': \'text/html\' }); res.end();
>
> });

#### statusCode

> This sets the status code of the response:
>
> response.statusCode
>
> []{#_bookmark593 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

##### Description

> This is used instead of response.writeHead. If this is called after
> writeHead has been executed, then it will not change the response
> header. It must be called instead of it.
>
> Here is an example that uses statusCode:
>
> server.on(\'request\', function (req, res) { res.statusCode = 404;
>
> res.end();
>
> });

#### setHeader

> This writes a specific header:
>
> response.setHeader(name, value)

##### Description

> In the same way that statusCode must be called instead of writeHead,
> setHeader must be called instead of writeHead. This can be called
> multiple times to set multiple headers.
>
> Here is an example of using statusCode and setHeader together:
>
> server.on(\'request\', function (req, res) { res.statusCode = 200;
> res.setHeader(\'Content-Type\', \'text/html\');
>
> res.setHeader(\'Custom-Header\', \'Custom-Value\'); res.end();
>
> });

#### write

> This is the function that writes the response body:
>
> response.write(chunk, \[encoding\])

##### Description

> *Chapter 12*
>
> The response.write parameter is a writable stream, so this interface
> can be used. A chunk can be a buffer or string. The encoding is
> optional as it will default to UTF8. Here is an example that writes a
> simple HTML page as the response:
>
> server.on(\'request\', function (req, res) { res.statusCode = 200;
> res.setHeader(\'Content-Type\', \'text/html\');
>
> res.write(\'\<html\>\<body\>\<h1\>Hello!\</h1\>\</body\>\</html\>\');
> res.end();
>
> });

#### end

> This ends the response:
>
> response.end(\[data\], \[encoding\])

##### Description

> The response parameter is a writable stream, so we must end the stream
> when we are done writing. Data is any optional data that needs to be
> written, and encoding will default to UTF8. All of the examples for
> response have used res.end. If you do not end the response, the
> browser will wait for a response from the server.

### http.request

> This makes a request using HTTP:
>
> http.request(options, \[callback\])

##### Return value

> This returns an http.ClientRequest object.

##### Description

> Node.js allows you to consume HTTP as well as serve it. The options
> object has many properties that can be set. Here is a list of them:

-   host

-   hostname

-   port

-   localAddress

> []{#_bookmark595 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

-   socketPath

-   method

-   path

-   headers

-   auth

-   agent

> Every option is not required for each request. Most of the time, only
> hostname, port, path, and method are needed to make a request. The
> options parameter can also be a URL as a string.
>
> The callback will be attached to the response event. The request
> object is a writable stream so that data can be sent to the server.
> Here is an example that makes a request to Packt Publishing:
>
> var request = http.request({ host: \'www.packtpub.com\', port: 80,
>
> path: \'/\', method: \'GET\'
>
> }, function (res) { console.log(res);
>
> });
>
> request.end();

### http.get {#http.get-1}

> This is the convenience method for a GET request:
>
> http.get(options, \[callback\])

#### Return value

> This returns a http.ClientRequest object.

#### Description

> This works in a manner similar to http.request, except it
> automatically sends an empty request and calls the end function. If
> you are only making a GET request, this can save some boilerplate
> code.

[]{#_bookmark596 .anchor}*Chapter 12*

> Here is an example that requests Packt Publishing:
>
> http.get(\'http://www.packtpub.com\', function (res) {
> console.log(res);
>
> });

### http.clientRequest

> This is the object that is returned from http.request.

#### write

> This writes to the server in the request:
>
> request.write(data, \[encoding\])

##### Description

> The http.clientRequest attribute is a writable stream. It is writable
> as you may need to send data to the remote server, for example, when
> making a POST request.
>
> This works like all the other writable streams, so data can be a
> buffer or string, and encoding will default to UTF8.

#### end

> This ends the request:
>
> request.end(\[data\], \[encoding\])

##### Description

> When you are writing to a stream, you must end the stream with this
> function. Without doing this, the connection will stay and/or timeout.
> Data is optional and can be a buffer or string, while encoding will
> default to UTF8.

#### response

> This is the response event. It lets you know that the remote server
> has responded:
>
> request.on(\'response\', function(response){})
>
> []{#_bookmark597 .anchor}*[Server-side JavaScript --
> NodeJS]{.underline}*

##### Description

> This event fires when the remote server responds. The response object
> in the callback
>
> will be http.incomingMessage.
>
> If no response handler is added, the server response will be
> discarded. If there is a response handler, then Node.js will start to
> buffer the response to memory. If you do not read it back out, you can
> cause the server to crash.
>
> Here is an example listener that reads the data from the response:

# Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS

Frontend Framework

> **Bootstrap** is a frontend framework and open source tool for
> developing websites and applications using HTML and CSS.
>
> **Twitter Blueprint** was the initial name given to Bootstrap. Mark
> Otto and Jacob Thornton developed Bootstrap and used Twitter as the
> framework for consistency. According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:
>
> *\"A super small group of developers and I got together to design and
> build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more.
> Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more
> substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with
> an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common
> design patterns and assets within the company.\"*
>
> The first official release of Bootstrap was August 19, 2011. There are
> currently three
>
> versions of Bootstrap. However, Bootstrap 4 has been announced
>
> but its final version is yet to be released.

## Introduction to Bootstrap foundations

> Bootstrap is compatible with the most recent versions of many web
> browsers including Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome,
> and Safari browsers.
>
> []{#_bookmark599 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### The HTML5 doctype

> To get started with Bootstrap, the following piece of code for HTML5
> doctype must be included in every bootstrap project:
>
> \<!DOCTYPE html\>
>
> \<html lang=\"en\"\>
>
> \...
>
> \</html\>

#### Mobile first

> Bootstrap is very mobile friendly. Mobile First styles are all
> included in a library and not scattered among various files. For
> accurate rendering and touch zooming, add the viewport meta tag to
> \<head\>:
>
> \<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-
> scale=1.0\"\>
>
> Zooming can be disabled by setting the property user-scalable to no in
> the viewport meta tag, as shown here:
>
> \<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-
> scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, **user-scalable=no\"**\>

#### Responsive images

> Images can be made to respond to various screen sizes using a simple
> class, as follows:
>
> \<img src=\"\...\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"Responsive image\"\>

#### Containers

> In bootstrap, all the web page content and the grid system is wrapped
> inside a main container. These containers are not nestable.
>
> There are two types of containers, they are as follows:

-   Responsive fixed width container, for example:

> \<div class=\"container\"\>\</div\>

-   Responsive full width container, for example:

> \<div class=\"container-fluid\"\>\</div\>

## Getting started

> *Chapter 13*
>
> It\'s now time to get started with your first Bootstrap project or
> website. You can get Bootstrap from various sources. For a kick start,
> here are a few sources for you to get your hands on Bootstrap.

#### The Github project

> Bootstrap is an open source project from the creators of Twitter. You
> can download it from their GitHub repository or any other command-line
> interface you prefer.

#### Downloading Bootstrap

> You can easily download Bootstrap from the following link:
> [https://github.com/](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v3.3.5/bootstrap-3.3.5-dist.zip)
> [twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v3.3.5/bootstrap-3.3.5-dist.zip](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v3.3.5/bootstrap-3.3.5-dist.zip)

#### Installing with bower

> You can install Bootstrap with bower using the following command:
>
> **\$ bower install bootstrap**

#### Installing with npm

> You can install Bootstrap with npm using the following command:
>
> **\$ npm install bootstrap**

#### Installing with composer

> You can install Bootstrap with composer using the following command:
>
> **\$ composer require twbs/bootstrap**

## Layouts

> Layouts help you to define a standard structure or the skeleton for
> your websites.
>
> There are three types of layouts:

-   Fixed layouts

-   Fluid layouts

-   Responsive layouts

> []{#_bookmark601 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*
>
> Fixed layouts do not change with screen size and all styles are
> static. Fluid layouts make the div elements flow to the bottom if they
> cannot be accommodated across the width of the viewing screen.
> Responsive layouts keep a very close eye on and respond to the
> adjusting screen sizes. These options can be used as described in the
> following sections.

#### Fixed layouts

> A fixed layout of a website has a wrapper (which wraps or contains all
> columns) of a constant width, that is, which cannot be changed no
> matter how small or how big the screen resolution is. The wrapper or
> the container cannot be moved and is set to a fixed position. The
> reason why many web designers prefer fixed layouts is due to ease in
> usage and customization.

#### Description

> In fixed layout, column widths are fixed and cannot be changed. The
> syntax for declaring fixed layouts for your website is as follows:
>
> \<body\>
>
> \<div class=\"container\"\> \<!\--This line is for declaring fixed
> layouts\--\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \</body\>
>
> Everything inside the container class in the preceding code will be
> fixed for every
>
> device in which this code is executed.

#### Fluid layouts

> A fluid layout acts just like a liquid and adjusts itself according to
> the screen resolution of the user at runtime. The components of such
> layouts mainly contain percentage widths and thus adjust to the
> user\'s screen effectively. Such layouts are more user friendly and
> make the website look better. It also improves accessibility and
> interface.

#### Description

> Fluid layouts adjust themselves according to the screen resolution
> they receive using predefined percentage widths. The syntax for
> declaring fluid layouts for your website is shown here:
>
> \<div class=\"container-fluid\"\> \<!\--declaration of a fluid
> container\--\>
>
> \<div class=\"row-fluid\"\>
>
> \<div class=\"span3\"\> \<!\--spans 3 columns \--\>
>
> \<!\--Sidebar content\--\>
>
> \</div\>

[]{#_bookmark602 .anchor}*Chapter 13*

> \<div class=\"span5\"\> \<!\--spans 5 columns \--\>
>
> \<!\--Body content\--\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> Bootstrap\'s grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.
>
> In the preceding example, span3 combines three columns and span5
> combines five columns, and together they complete the whole page
> adjusting the layout according to the screen resolution.

#### Responsive layouts

> Responsive layouts provide a design for a website depending on the
> number of conditions, which include ratios, widths, display types, and
> so on. Such layouts automatically adjust and adapt to any screen size,
> thus providing better accessibility and optimal viewing experience to
> the user.

#### Description

> Responsive layouts are a growing trend among web designers as they
> offer less hassles in customization and implementation.
>
> The following example code shows how you can include responsive
> features using meta tags along with a Bootstrap stylesheet:
>
> \<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-
> scale=1.0\"\>
>
> \<link href=\"assets/css/bootstrap-responsive.css\"
> rel=\"stylesheet\"\>

#### Supported devices

> To provide effective layouts on a number of different devices,
> Bootstrap can support many media queries in one file. The following
> table shows the range of devices that are supported:

+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+--------------+
| > **Label**     | > **Layout      | > **Column      | > **Gutter   |
|                 | > width**       | > width**       | > width**    |

## The grid system

> Use rows and columns to create a grid of a specific size and add data
> to it. Here are a
>
> few guidelines to keep in mind:

-   Place rows in a .container(fixed-width) or .container-fluid(full-
    width) methods for accurate alignment.

-   Horizontal groups of columns can be created using rows. Insert data
    in columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows.

> Padding is used by columns for creating gutters. That cushioning is
> counterbalanced
>
> in lines for the first and the last section by means of negative edge
> on .lines. Initiate columns by specifying the number columns. Not more
> than 12 columns can be initiated in a row, all extra columns will jump
> on a new line. Grid classes apply to devices with screen widths
> greater than or equal to the breakpoint sizes, and overrides grid
> classes targeted at smaller devices.

#### The grid options cheat sheet

> The following table shows some effective ways in which the Bootstrap
> grid system can be used to work for multiple devices:

#### Media queries

> *Chapter 13*
>
> Media queries help the website to adjust the styles according to the
> screen size. We can use the media queries in our LESS files in order
> to create the key breakpoints in our grid system. Observing the cheat
> sheet, we can write media queries. Let\'s take a look at the following
> code snippet:
>
> /\* Large Device (\>=1200 px) \*/
>
> \@media (min-width: \@screen-lg-min) { \... }
>
> /\*Medium Devices (\>=992 px)\*/
>
> \@media (min-width: \@screen-md-min) { \... }
>
> /\* Small Devices such as Tablets (\>=768px) \*/ \@media (min-width:
> \@screen-sm-min) { \... }
>
> /\* Extra small devices such as Phones (\<768px)\*/
>
> /\* No media query as this is the default\*/
>
> We occasionally expand on these media queries to include a max width
> to limit CSS to a narrower set of devices:
>
> /\* Large Device (\>=1200 px) \*/
>
> \@media (min-width: \@screen-lg-min) { \... }
>
> /\*Medium Devices (\>=992 px)\*/
>
> \@media (min-width: \@screen-md-min) and (max-width: \@screen-md-max)
>
> { \... }
>
> /\* Small Devices such as Tablets (\>=768px) \*/
>
> \@media (min-width: \@screen-sm-min) and (max-width: \@screen-sm-max)
>
> { \... }
>
> /\* Extra small devices such as Phones (\<768px)\*/ \@media
> (max-width: \@screen-xs-max) { \... }

#### Responsive column resets

> We need these types of columns because sometimes in a grid, not all
> the columns end with the same alignment due to a varying amount of
> data in it. However, responsive columns will ensure that everything is
> perfectly aligned. Let\'s take a look at the following code snippet:
>
> \<div class=\"row\"\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-3\" style=\"background-color:pink\"\>.
> col-xs-6 .col-sm-3\</div\>
>
> []{#_bookmark605 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*
>
> \<div class=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-3\" style=\"background-
> color:brown;\"\>.col-xs-6 .col-sm-3\</div\>\</div\>
>
> \<!\-- Add the extra clearfix for only the required viewport \--\>
>
> \<div class=\"clearfix visible-xs-block\"\>\</div\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-3\" style=\"background-
> color:orange;\>.col-xs-6 .col-sm-3\</div\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-3\" style=\"background-
> color:black;\>.col-xs-6 .col-sm-3\</div\>
>
> \</div\>

#### Offsetting columns

> Sometimes, we need to place a column or start a column with some free
> space offset. So, we set an offset from where the column needs to
> begin:
>
> \<div class=\"row\"\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-md-4\"\>.col-md-4\</div\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-md-4 col-md-offset-4\"\>.col-md-4 .col-md-offset-
> 4\</div\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \<div class=\"row\"\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-md-3 col-md-offset-3\"\>.col-md-3 .col-md-offset-
> 3\</div\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-md-3 col-md-offset-3\"\>.col-md-3 .col-md-offset-
> 3\</div\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \<div class=\"row\"\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\"\>.col-md-6 .col-md-offset-
> 3\</div\>
>
> \</div\>

#### Nesting columns

> As the name suggests, nesting columns are an embedment of a column
> within a column. Let\'s take a look at the following code snippet:
>
> \<div class=\"row\"\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-md-9\"\> Level 1: .col-md-9
>
> \<div class=\"row\"\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-md-6\"\> Level 2: .col-md-6

[]{#_bookmark606 .anchor}*Chapter 13*

> \</div\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-md-6\"\> Level 2: .col-md-6
>
> \</div\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \</div\>

#### Column ordering

> Column ordering can also be changed by moving columns to right or
> left. The following code shows how columns can be moved:
>
> \<div class=\"row\"\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-md-9 col-md-push-3\"\>.col-md-9 .col-md-push-
> 3\</div\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-md-3 col-md-pull-9\"\>.col-md-3 .col-md-pull-
> 9\</div\>
>
> \</div\>

#### LESS variables and mixins

> LESS mixins and variables are used to quickly instantiate a layout
> using specific
>
> values given through variables and mixins.

#### Mixins

> Mixins are mainly used together with grid variables to provide CSS
> styles for individual elements.

##### Description

> Mixins, as the name suggests, are a way of including or mixing a group
> of properties from one rule set into another rule set. The following
> example shows the make-row() mixin:
>
> make-row (@gutter: grid-gutter-width) { margin-left : (@gutter / -2);
>
> margin-right : (@gutter/ -2); &: extend( .clearfix all);
>
> }
>
> The make-row() mixin generates styles for the wrapper element, which
> contains all the columns. It uses the value from the \@gutter
> parameter to calculate the left and right margins for a row.
>
> []{#_bookmark607 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### Variables

> The media query point from where columns start floating, total number
> of columns and gutter width are determined by variables. This
> information is provided by variables in order to generate predefined
> grid classes and for custom mixins as well.

##### Description

> Variables are used along with mixins to generate styles for individual
> elements.
>
> The following piece of code predefines some variables that are used in
> mixins as
>
> default values:
>
> //Number of columns in the grid. \@grid-columns: 12;
>
> //padding between columns. Divided in half for left and right.
> \@grid-gutter-width: 30px;
>
> //point at which the navbar collapses. \@grid-float-breakpoint: 768px;

## Typography

> **Typography** is the art and technique of arranging type elements to
> make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed
> with the use of headings, bold fonts, italic fonts, strong fonts,
> lists, and so on.

#### Headings

> In Bootstrap, all headings from h1 to h6 are available from HTML.
> Headings are mainly used to highlight the main topics under
> discussion. The heading text should be included between proper HTML
> heading tags, for example, \<h1\> Here is the heading text \</h1\>.
> The heading size decreases as the heading number increases, providing
> the facility to highlight the main topics and subtopics. This
> technique helps in managing a proper design for the website.
>
> Here are a few examples of how headings can be used:
>
> \<h1\> This is a Bootstrap heading H1\</h1\>
>
> \<h2\> This is a Bootstrap heading H2\</h2\>
>
> \<h3\> This is a Bootstrap heading H3\</h3\>
>
> \<h4\> This is a Bootstrap heading H4\</h4\>
>
> \<h5\> This is a Bootstrap heading H5\</h5\>
>
> \<h6\> This is a Bootstrap heading H6\</h6\>

#### Body {#body-2}

> *Chapter 13*
>
> All the HTML tags related to typography and design must be included
> within the body tags, for example, text, hyperlinks, images, tables,
> lists, and so on. The following code shows a paragraph tag, which
> shows the text in a paragraph:
>
> \<p\>\...\</p\>

#### Lead body

> The lead class helps make the text inside the tags stand out. The
> method of its declaration is as stated here:
>
> \<p class=\"lead\"\>\...\</p\>

#### Emphasis

> Emphasis basically affiliates the size and font of the text to its
> importance in a document. For example, larger text would have more
> importance than smaller text or text in italics might contain a
> reference from another resource.

#### Small text

> The text within the small tags is mainly reduced to 85% of the
> original size. This technique is mainly used to lessen the importance
> of the text:
>
> \<small\>\...\</small\>

#### Bold text

> The text within the strong tags is made more visible by making it
> larger and bolder. This helps in increasing the emphasis of the text
> in the document:
>
> \<strong\>\...\</strong\>

#### Italics text

> The text within the em tags is italicized. This technique is mainly
> used to denote references, among many other uses:
>
> \<em\>\...\</em\>
>
> []{#_bookmark609 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### Alignment

> Alignment is a basic technique used to align a paragraph to the left,
> right, or center of the screen, regardless of the screen resolution:
>
> \<p class=\"text-left\"\>Text here will be left-aligned\</p\>
>
> \<p class=\"text-center\"\> Text here will be center-aligned \</p\>
>
> \<p class=\"text-right\"\> Text here will be right-aligned \</p\>

#### Abbreviations

> The customized \<abbr\> element of HTML can be used with the following
> syntax as shown in the following code snippet.

#### Basic

> The \<abbr\> tag shows a smaller version of text and is expanded when
> the mouse is hovered over it:
>
> \<abbr title=\"attribute\"\>Here is an example of an attribute
> tag\</abbr\>
>
> The output of this code will show the attr abbreviation.

#### Initialism

> **Initialism** has the same functionality as the basic abbreviation
> but with smaller text:
>
> \<abbr title=\"HyperText Markup Language\" class=\"initialism\"\>HTML
> using Initialism\</abbr\>

#### Addresses

> Address tags are used to accommodate all text related to an address.
> The following example shows the format:
>
> \<address\> ...
>
> \<strong\>Packt PublishingPublishing.\</strong\>\<br\> Berwick House,
> \<br\>
>
> 35 Livery St, \<br\> Birmingham B3 2PB,\<br\> United Kingdom \<br\>
>
> \<abbr title=\"Phone\"\>P:\</abbr\> +44 121 265 6484
>
> \</address\>

#### Blockquotes

> *Chapter 13*
>
> **Blockquotes** are mainly used for quoting text from another source.
> They are used with paragraph tags for quoting a paragraph:
>
> \<blockquotes\> ... \</blockquotes\>

## Tables

> Tables are used to clearly display the contents in an organized form
> so that data is easily accessible and readable.

+--------+-------------------+-----------------+----------------------+
| >      | > **Category**    | > **Item**      | > **ItemID**         |
| **\#** |                   |                 |                      |
+========+===================+=================+======================+
| > 1    | > Apparel         | > Blue Shirt    | > App_BlueShirt      |
+--------+-------------------+-----------------+----------------------+
| > 2    | > Apparel         | > White Coat    | > App_WhiteCoat      |
+--------+-------------------+-----------------+----------------------+
| > 3    | > Accessories     | > Leather Belt  | > Acc_LeatherBelt    |
+--------+-------------------+-----------------+----------------------+

#### Basic

> In the preceding table, is the basic version of a Bootstrap table with
> light padding and horizontal dividers only. The syntax is as follows:
>
> \<table class=\"table\"\> \... \</table\>

#### Striped rows

> The structure of striped rows is the same as that of the basic table,
> its style is similar to the strips of zebra crossing, that is, lighter
> and darker alternative rows:
>
> \<table class=\"table table-striped\"\> \... \</table\>

#### Bordered table

> This class converts a table into equal divisions with visible
> boundaries. Each division contains a single value:
>
> \<table class=\"table table-bordered\"\> \... \</table\>

#### Hover rows

> This class adds the feature that highlights the row on which the mouse
> hovers:
>
> \<table class=\"table table-hover\"\> \... \</table\>
>
> []{#_bookmark611 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### Condensed rows

> A more squeezed and smaller version of a table can be achieved by
> decreasing the padding between rows:
>
> \<table class=\"table table-condensed\"\> \... \</table\>

#### Contextual classes

> Contextual classes when applied to table rows or cells, give them
> predefined colors.
>
> Here are a few available classes:

-   .active: This class applies a hover color to the table row

-   .success: This class applies green color to the table row

-   .info: This class applies blue color to the table row

-   .warning: This class applies yellow color to the table row

-   .danger: This class applies red color to the table row

> We can set entire rows or individual cells to display a certain color
> to denote a particular message. Here is an example of how this can be
> achieved:
>
> \<!\-- Contextual classes when applied on rows \--\>
>
> \<tr class=\"active\"\>\...\</tr\>
>
> \<tr class=\"success\"\>\...\</tr\>
>
> \<tr class=\"warning\"\>\...\</tr\>
>
> \<tr class=\"danger\"\>\...\</tr\>
>
> \<!\-- Contextual classes when applied on cells (\`td\` or \`th\`)
> \--\>
>
> \<tr\> \<td class=\"active\"\>\...\</td\>
>
> \<td class=\"success\"\>\...\</td\>
>
> \<td class=\"warning\"\>\...\</td\>
>
> \<td class=\"danger\"\>\...\</td\> \</tr\>

#### Responsive tables

> Responsive tables adjust themselves to scroll horizontally on small
> devices. The difference is only visible on small devices:
>
> \<div class=\"table-responsive\"\>
>
> \<table class=\"table\"\> \... \</table\>
>
> \</div\>

## Lists

> *Chapter 13*
>
> Lists are used to group data in a certain order, or it can be
> ungrouped to display data in a sequential form.
>
> Lists can be of the following types:

-   Unordered

-   Ordered

-   Unstyled

-   Inline

-   Description

#### Unordered lists

> An unordered list is a collection of items in which the order does not
> matter. Here is the syntax of an unordered list:
>
> \<ul\>
>
> \<li\>\...\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\...\</li\>
>
> \</ul\>

#### Ordered lists

> An ordered list is a collection of items where the order does matter.
> Here is the syntax of an ordered list:
>
> \<ol\>
>
> \<li\>\...\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\...\</li\>
>
> \</ol\>

#### Unstyled lists

> Unstyled lists can be ordered or unordered with the removal of the
> left margin and the default list style. Here is the syntax of an
> unstyled list:
>
> \<ul class=\"list-unstyled\"\>
>
> \<li\>\...\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\...\</li\>
>
> \</ul\>
>
> []{#_bookmark613 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### Inline lists

> Inline lists arrange all items of a list into a single line or row.
> Here is the syntax of an inline list:
>
> \<ul class=\"list-inline\"\>
>
> \<li\>\...\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\...\</li\>
>
> \</ul\>

#### Description lists

> A description list contains the list items along with their
> descriptions. Here is the syntax of a description list:
>
> \<dl\>
>
> \<dt\>\...\</dt\>
>
> \<dd\>\...\</dd\>
>
> \</dl\>

#### Horizontal description

> The horizontal description class does the same thing as the
> description list class with the only difference being the placement of
> the corresponding description of the list item in the same line. Here
> is the syntax of an horizontal description list:
>
> \<dl class=\"dl-horizontal\"\>
>
> \<dt\>\...\</dt\>
>
> \<dd\>\...\</dd\>
>
> \</dl\>

## Forms in Bootstrap

> Form elements are various elements used in Bootstrap to make
> navigation and GUI more appealing and satisfying. Use of various text
> boxes, buttons, and so on enable better output.
>
> There are three types of layout for forms:

-   Vertical forms

-   Inline forms

-   Horizontal forms

#### Vertical forms

> *Chapter 13*
>
> Vertical forms are the default layout of bootstrap forms. The
> attribute used here is role and the value of it is set to form to
> provide better accessibility and automatic and default styling for the
> form. The syntax for this is as follows:
>
> \<form role=\"form\"\> ... \</form\>

#### Inline forms

> Many a time, we also come across forms in which the elements of the
> forms are present inline and in a single line and left aligned. Inline
> forms are required to have the form-inline class for the \<form\>
> element. The syntax for this as follows:
>
> \<form class=\"form-inline\" role=\"form\"\> ... \</form\>

#### Horizontal forms

> A horizontal form is the most nifty of this set and is broadly used on
> web pages to collect data from website users. The appearance and
> performance of this form is something that sets it apart from the
> other two types of forms. This form aligns labels and groups of form
> controls in a horizontal layout.
>
> Horizontal forms are required to have the form-horizontal class for
> the \<form\> element. Additionally, labels are to have the
> control-label class for the \<label\> element. The syntax is as
> follows:
>
> \<form class=\"form-horizontal\" role=\"form\"\> ... \</form\>

#### Inputs for forms in Bootstrap

> All different input types supported by HTML are available to use even
> in Bootstrap, making it simple for someone from an HTML background to
> grasp the concepts.
>
> Inputs such as textarea, password, radio button, checkbox and many
> more are supported in Bootstrap.
>
> The syntax for a simple text box as a means of input is as follows:
>
> \<input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Text
> input\" id =\"txtName\"\>
>
> []{#_bookmark615 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*
>
> If we want the text altered to not show the actual letters being typed
> in, then we can use the input type as password. The syntax for using
> the input type as password is as follows:
>
> \<input type=\"password\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Text
> input\" id=\"txtPassword\"\>

#### Textarea

> The textarea is an area that holds text entered by the user; it can
> hold small words to large paragraphs. The syntax for textarea is as
> follows:
>
> \<textarea class=\"form-control\" rows=\"44\"\>\</textarea\>
>
> The preceding line tells the control that the textarea must span four
> rows.

#### Help text

> The help block provides block-level help text for form controls:
>
> \<span class=\"help-block\"\> \</span\>

#### Checkbox

> The checkbox control allocates a box to a certain group of related
> options that can be selected by clicking on the box. This feature is
> used when the user is required to select only from the given options.
> The syntax for adding a checkbox is as follows:
>
> \<div class=\"checkbox\"\> \</div\>
>
> Here is the syntax to add a checkbox that is disabled:
>
> \<div class=\"checkbox disabled\"\> \</div\>

#### Select list

> The select class control triggers a dropdown menu that contains a
> group of options from which only one can be selected at a time. Its
> syntax is as follows:
>
> \<select class=\"form-control\"\> ... \</form\>

#### Radio button

> *Chapter 13*
>
> The radio class control does the same as the checkbox except that the
> user can choose only one option at a time. Its syntax is as follows:
>
> \<div class=\"radio\"\> ... \</div\>
>
> Here is the syntax to add a radio class that is disabled:
>
> \<div class=\"radio disabled\"\> \</div\>

#### Static control

> The static class control allows the user to insert text in a
> horizontal form next to its corresponding label. Text can be added
> next to a form label in a horizontal form using the
> \"form-control-static\" class within paragraph tags. The form-static-
> control class must be used.
>
> The following example inserts the static text---Web Developer\'s
> Reference Guide:
>
> \<p class=\"form-control-static\"\>Web Developer\'s Reference
> Guide\<p\>

#### Input focus

> The input class lets an input field automatically focus when the page
> loads. Its
>
> syntax is as follows:
>
> \<input class=\"form-control\" id=\"focusedInput\" type=\"text\"
> value=\"\...\"\>

#### Disabled input

> The disabled attribute disables input in a particular text box, it
> cannot be clicked on or used. To use this, the disabled attribute can
> be added to a \<fieldset\> tag to disable all of its controls.

#### Validation states

> These classes give meaning to input controls when returning a message
> from the
>
> server such as fields that were left empty or when an incorrect
> combination is entered.
>
> Validation states can be used by adding .has-success, .has-warning, or
> .has- error in a class. This is shown in the following code:
>
> \<div class=\"form-group has-success\"\> ... \</div\>
>
> \<div class=\"form-group has-warning\"\> ... \</div\>
>
> \<div class=\"form-group has-error\"\> ... \</div\>
>
> []{#_bookmark617 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### Control sizing

> Users can easily set the height of various columns as per their
> requirement.
>
> We can easily set heights and widths using classes such as .input-lg
> and .col-lg-\*:
>
> \<input class=\"form-control input-lg\" type=\"text\"
> placeholder=\".input-lg\"\>
>
> \<div class=\"col-xs-2\"\> ... \</div\>

## Images

> We can add classes to an \<img\> element for image manipulation using
> built-in CSS styles:
>
> \<img src=\"\...\" alt=\"\...\" class=\"img-rounded\"\>
>
> \<img src=\"\...\" alt=\"\...\" class=\"img-circle\"\>
>
> \<img src=\"\...\" alt=\"\...\" class=\"img-thumbnail\"\>
>
> The preceding code will create the following images:

![](./images-ref/media/image124.png)

> ![](./images-ref/media/image125.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365748031496063in"}Note that Internet Explorer 8 lacks
> support for rounded corners in images.

#### Icons (Glyphicons)

> *Chapter 13*
>
> **Glyphicons** are small icons used to help the user understand the
> meaning of a function. For example, an e-mail will have an envelope
> icon, search would have a magnifying glass icon, and so on. Some
> [Glyphicons](http://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.0.3/docs/components/#glyphicons)
> are shown in the following diagram:

![](./images-ref/media/image126.png)

> More than 250 Glyphicons in font format are present in the **Glyphicon
> Halflings** set. Here is how to add Glyphicons in Bootstrap:
>
> \<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-search\"\>\</span\>
>
> []{#_bookmark619 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image127.png){width="0.4178423009623797in"
> height="0.3365780839895013in"}All the available Glyphicons can be
> found at [http://getbootstrap.](http://getbootstrap.com/components/)
> [com/components/](http://getbootstrap.com/components/).

## Navigation elements

> Bootstrap supports multiple types of navigation element and can be
> used as described in the following code:

#### Tabs

> The tab class creates small tabs on the navigation bar, and each tab
> provides a link to different pages:
>
> \<ul class=\"nav nav-tabs\"\> ... \</ul\>
>
> The tabs basically are links to other pages or websites; thus, the tab
> class should be declared within the link tags, as shown in the
> preceding code.

#### Pills

> The pill class has the same functionality as the tab class, with the
> only difference being the styling. The tabs now appear like pills:
>
> \<ul class=\"nav nav-pills\"\> ... \</ul\>

#### Justified

> Adding an additional class of nav-justified would allow tabs or pills
> to automatically adjust themselves according to the screen resolution.
> The tabs or pills are given equal widths:
>
> \<ul class=\"nav nav-tabs nav-justified\"\> ... \</ul\>

#### Disabled links

> Adding a disabled class to a tab or pill in a navigation bar would
> remove the hover state, disabling the access to the link:
>
> \<ul class=\"nav nav-pills\"\>
>
> \...
>
> \<li class=\"disabled\"\>\<a href=\"#\"\>Disabled link\</a\>\</li\>

\...

\</ul\>

[]{#_bookmark620 .anchor}*Chapter 13*

> ![](./images-ref/media/image128.png){width="0.41783792650918633in"
> height="0.3365780839895013in"}Remember to place the actual link in
> place of #.

## The navigation bar

> Navigation in Bootstrap helps in navigating through the website. It
> allows quick access to the links a user visits often.

#### Default

> The navbar class is used to create a simple navigation bar by
> including .navbar and
>
> .navbar-default in the navigation tab:
>
> \<nav class=\"navbar navbar-default\" role=\"navigation\"\>
>
> To make a scalable, responsive menu bar that collapses to a dropdown
> when displaying on mobile devices, use the following class to wrap the
> bar:
>
> \<div class=\"navbar-header\"\>

#### Forms

> You can also put forms within a navigation bar by adding the
> .navbar-form class:
>
> \<form class=\"navbar-form navbar-left\" role=\"search\"\>

#### Buttons

> Similar to the navbar class, .navbar-btn adds a button to the bar that
> can perform many useful functions:
>
> \<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default navbar-btn\"\> ...
>
> \</button\>

#### Text

> By adding the .navbar-text class, we can also add text to the
> navigation bar:
>
> \<p class=\"navbar-text\"\> ... \</p\>
>
> []{#_bookmark621 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### Non-nav links

> The navbar-link class allows us to add standard links that are not in
> the navbar
>
> navigation component:
>
> \<p class=\"navbar-text navbar-right\"\>
>
> \<a href=\"#\" class=\"navbar-link\"\>\</a\>
>
> \</p\>

#### Fixed to top

> Adding the navbar-fixed-top class within the \<nav\> tabs allows
> navbar to dynamically position itself at the top of the page. Here is
> its syntax:
>
> \<nav class=\"navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top\"
> role=\"navigation\"\>

#### Fixed to bottom

> The navbar-fixed-bottom class allows the navigation bar to sit right
> at the bottom of the page. Here is its syntax:
>
> \<nav class=\"navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-bottom\"
> role=\"navigation\"\>

#### Static top

> The navbar-static-top class adds a new feature to the navigation bar
> that allows the element to scroll along with the page. Here is its
> syntax:
>
> \<nav class=\"navbar navbar-default navbar-static-top\"
> role=\"navigation\"\>

#### Inverted navbar

> The navbar-inverse class only changes the color of the navigation bar
> and turns it into the opposite color. For example, navbar gets a black
> background with white text:
>
> \<nav class=\"navbar navbar-inverse\" role=\"navigation\"\>

## Panels

> Panels are simple boxes that contain plain text. Panels are mostly
> used in order to present important information in a visually favorable
> way.

#### Basic

> *Chapter 13*
>
> A basic panel consists of a single box containing some text. The
> method of its declaration is shown here:
>
> \<div class=\"panel panel-default\"\> ... \</div\>

#### Heading

> The panel-heading class adds an additional box above the basic panel,
> which contains its heading or title. Both boxes are of different
> colors by default. Here is the syntax:
>
> \<div class=\"panel-heading\"\>This is a Panel Heading\</div\>

#### Footer

> The panel-footer class adds a box beneath a basic panel which also
> contains text of some sort. Here is the syntax:
>
> \<div class=\"panel-footer\"\>This is a Panel Footer\</div\>

#### Group

> Panels under the panel-group class are grouped together. Here is the
> syntax:
>
> \<div class=\"panel-group\"\>

## Breadcrumbs

> Breadcrumbs serve as a helping tool that keeps track of the path you
> take to visit different pages. Using breadcrumbs, you can know the
> current location of a page on a website.
>
> Breadcrumbs are used to find out the current page\'s path in a
> navigation hierarchy.
>
> Here is a sample code:
>
> \<ol class=\"breadcrumb\"\>
>
> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>Home\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>Library\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \<li class=\"active\"\>Data\</li\>
>
> \</ol\>
>
> []{#_bookmark623 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*

## Labels and badges

> Labels and badges offer help tools that keep track of the progressive
> factors, such as numerical indicators, counts, percentages, and so on,
> by keeping counts or by showing the status of a website being loaded
> and so on.

#### Labels

> Labels are associated with different headings or titles which help in
> keeping records of counts or give tips among other things. Labels can
> be declared as follows:
>
> \<h3\>This is an example Heading\<span class=\"label label-
> default\"\>This is an example label\</span\>\</h3\>

#### Badges

> Badges are the same as labels with the only difference being the
> shape. Badges have more curved shapes than labels. They are mainly
> used to notify the user of the new changes, unseen e-mails, and so on.
> Let\'s take a look at the following code snippet:
>
> \<a href=\"#\"\>Check EMailsEMails \<span
> class=\"badge\"\>4545\</span\>\</a\>

## Pagination

> **Pagination** is the grouping of data on various pages like a
> textbook where data of same importance is usually posted on the same
> page for better accessibility.
>
> Pagination is highly scalable and provides larger click areas which
> are hard to miss. Pagination can be used along with tables and is
> useful for paginating search results.

#### Default

> Following is a basic example of bootstrap pagination:
>
> \<ul class=\"pagination\"\>
>
> \<li\>
>
> \<a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Previous\"\>
>
> \<span aria-hidden=\"true\"\>&laquo;\</span\>
>
> \</a\>
>
> \</li\>
>
> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>1\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>2\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>3\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>4\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>5\</a\>\</li\>

[]{#_bookmark624 .anchor}*Chapter 13*

> \<li\>
>
> \<a href=\"#\" aria-label=\"Next\"\>
>
> \<span aria-hidden=\"true\"\>&raquo;\</span\>
>
> \</a\>
>
> \</li\>
>
> \</ul\>
>
> Adding .active to \<li\> will highlight the current page link:
>
> \<li class=\'active\'\>\<a href=\"#\"\>3\</a\>\</li\>
>
> Adding .disabled to \<li\> will disable the page link and make it
> unclickable:
>
> \<li class=\'disabled\'\>\<a href=\"#\"\>3\</a\>\</li\>

#### Pager

> The next and previous links are used in pagination for quick access.
> Pagers are mainly used by simple sites such as magazines, newspapers,
> or blogs, and so on. Here is the syntax:
>
> \<ul class=\"pager\"\> ... \</ul\>

## Progress bars

> A basic progress bar is a rectangular bar that fills according to the
> level of progress achieved. These bars are mainly used for the purpose
> of showing current progress regarding an action.
>
> Here is the code to create progress bars:
>
> \<div class=\"progress\"\>
>
> \<div class=\"progress-bar\" role=\"progressbar\" aria-
> valuenow=\"505\"
>
> aria-valuemin=\"0\" aria-valuemax=\"100\" style=\"width:505%\"\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \</div\>
>

## Advanced Bootstrap/JavaScript plugins

> Bootstrap can benefit from powerful JavaScript libraries to display
> various kinds of dynamic content on web pages. Bootstrap plugins
> require jQuery as a dependency. These include buttons, dropdowns,
> tooltips, alerts, tabs, and more. We will now cover how to use them.

#### Buttons

> Buttons in Bootstrap can be used under various combinations.

#### Basic

> The btn-group class generates a default grey button with curved edges
> that can trigger any function when clicked on by the user:
>
> \<div class=\"btn-group\"\> ... \</div\>

#### Button toolbar

> The btn-toolbar class groups together all buttons that are included in
> the
>
> btn-toolbar class:
>
> \<div class=\"btn-toolbar\" role=\"toolbar\"\> ... \</div\>

#### Sizing

> The sizing class is used to size groups of buttons at once by just
> adding btn- group-\*.
>
> The declaration is shown here:
>
> \<div class=\"btn-group btn-group-lg\"\>\...\</div\> //large
>
> \<div class=\"btn-group\"\>\...\</div\> //normal
>
> \<div class=\"btn-group btn-group-sm\"\>\...\</div\> //small
>
> \<div class=\"btn-group btn-group-xs\"\>\...\</div\> //extra small

#### Nesting

> Creating drop-down menus with a series of buttons can be done by
> placing a
>
> btn-group within a btn-group as shown here:
>
> \<div class=\"btn-group\" role=\"group\" aria-label=\"\...\"\>
>
> \<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\"\>Alpha\</button\>
>
> \<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\"\>Beta\</button\>

[]{#_bookmark626 .anchor}*Chapter 13*

> \<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\"\>Gamma\</button
>
> \<div class=\"btn-group\" role=\"group\"\>
>
> \<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default dropdown-toggle\"
> data-toggle =\"dropdown\"\> List of Top Publishers\</button\>
>
> \<ul class=\"Top Publishers\"\>
>
> \<li\>\<a
> [href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/\"\>](http://www.packtpub.com/) Packt
> Publishing\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\<a
> [href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/\"\>](http://www.oreilly.com/)
> O\'Reilly\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \</ul\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \</div\>

#### Vertical variation

> The btn-group-vertical class arranges a group of buttons in a vertical
> fashion. Here is the syntax:
>
> \<div class=\"btn-group-vertical\"\> \... \</div\>

#### Justified link variation

> The btn-group-justified class allows the button groups to adjust
> themselves according to any screen resolution and provides equal
> widths to the buttons. Here is the syntax:
>
> \<div class=\"btn-group btn-group-justified\"\> \... \</div\>

#### Dropdowns

> Dropdown menus are triggered when a button is clicked on the dropdown
> by the user. Dropdowns are mainly used to access additional related
> links.

#### Single button

> The btn btn-default dropdown-toggle class changes a button into a
> simple drop- down menu. Its declaration is shown in the following
> code:
>
> \<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default dropdown-toggle\"
> data-toggle=\"dropdown\"\>
>
> \<span class=\"caret\"\>\</span\>
>
> \</button\>
>
> []{#_bookmark627 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### Split button

> The btn btn-danger class does not change the button entirely into a
> dropdown, rather it splits a button into two parts where one performs
> a simple button function and the other becomes a dropdown menu:
>
> \<div class=\"btn-group\"\>
>
> \<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-danger\"\>Action\</button\>
>
> \<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-danger dropdown-toggle\"
> data- toggle=\"dropdown\"\>
>
> \<span class=\"caret\"\>\</span\>
>
> \<span class=\"sr-only\"\>Toggle for Dropdown\</span\>
>
> \</button\>
>
> \</div\>

#### Tooltips

> Tooltips are small boxes that pop up when the pointer is hovered over
> an element.
>
> To create a tooltip, add the data-toggle=\"tooltip\" attribute to an
> element. Add the data-toggle=\"tooltip\" attribute to an element to
> create a tooltip. To specify the text that is displayed inside a
> tooltip, use the title attribute:
>
> \<a href=\"#\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" title=\"Tooltip\"\>...\</a\>

#### Positioning

> The positioning tool is used to position a popup box of tooltips, for
> example, when a box may pop up on the top or bottom or to the left or
> right of an element:
>
> Here is the syntax for positioning it at the top:
>
> \<a href=\"#\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data- placement=\"top\"
> title=\"Tooltip\"\>Tooltip at the top\</a\>
>
> Here is the syntax for positioning it at the bottom:
>
> \<a href=\"#\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-
>
> placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Tooltip\"\> Tooltip at the bottom\</a\>
>
> Here is the syntax for positioning it on the left of the element:
>
> \<a href=\"#\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-
>
> placement=\"left\" title=\"Tooltip\"\>Tooltip at the left\</a\>

[]{#_bookmark628 .anchor}*Chapter 13*

> Here is the syntax for positioning it on the right of the element:
>
> \<a href=\"#\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-
>
> placement=\"right\" title=\"Tooltip\"\> Tooltip at the right\</a\>
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image130.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365824584426947in"}Remember to place the actual link in
> place of #.

#### Popovers

> Popovers and tooltips have the same functionalities with the only
> difference that for popovers to appear, the element needs to be
> clicked on by the user. They are used to present additional
> information regarding the element.

#### Basic creation

> Popovers can be generated using the following piece of code:
>
> \<a href=\"#\" data-toggle=\"popover\" title=\"Popover Header\" data-
> content=\"Some content inside the popover\"\>Toggle popover\</a\>

#### Positioning

> Popovers can be positioned on the top or bottom or to the left or
> right of the element using the following code.
>
> Here is the syntax for positioning the popovers at the top:
>
> \<a href=\"#\" title=\"Header\" data-toggle=\"popover\" data-
> placement=\"top\" data-Content=\"Content\"\> Popover at the top \</a\>
>
> Here is the syntax for positioning it at the bottom:
>
> \<a href=\"#\" title=\"Header\" data-toggle=\"popover\" data-
> placement=\"bottom\" data-content=\"Content\"\> Popover at the bottom
>
> \</a\>
>
> Here is the syntax for positioning it on the left:
>
> \<a href=\"#\" title=\"Header\" data-toggle=\"popover\" data-
> placement=\"left\" data-content=\"Content\"\> Popover at the
> leftleft\</a\>
>
> Here is the syntax for positioning it on the right:
>
> \<a href=\"#\" title=\"Header\" data-toggle=\"popover\" data-
> placement=\"right\" data-content=\"Content\"\>PopoverPopover at the
> right \</a\>
>
> []{#_bookmark629 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image131.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365780839895013in"} Remember to place the actual link in
> place of #.

#### Closing

> The popover class allows the popover to close when you click
> elsewhere:
>
> \<a href=\"#\" title=\"Dismissible popover\" data-toggle=\"popover\"
> data-trigger=\"focus\" data-content=\"Click anywhere in the document
> to close the popover\"\>Click here to close popover\</a\>

#### Alerts

> Bootstrap provides the utility of displaying alert messages. The code
> for its declaration is shown here. Bootstrap also allows you to assign
> different colors to alert messages to signify different situations.
> Bootstrap requires jQuery, and \$ in this syntax means we are invoking
> jQuery. Let\'s take a look at the following code:
>
> \<button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"alert\" aria
> label=\"Close\"\> \<span aria-hidden=\"true\"\>&times;\</span\>
> \</button\>
>
> The syntax of an alert is as follows:
>
> \$().alert():
>
> This listens for click events on its elements having
> data-dismiss-alert. The syntax is as follows:
>
> \$().alert(\'close\'):
>
> This removes an alert from the DOM. The element will fade out if it
> includes the
>
> .fade and .in classes.

#### Tabs

> Tabs are used in navigation bars to provide quick access to different
> links or pages. Tabs need to be individually activated, as follows:
>
> \<div class=\"container\"\>
>
> \<h1\>Alpha Zoo\</h1\>
>
> \<ul class=\"nav nav-tabs\"\>
>
> \<li class=\"active\"\>
>
> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>Exhibit A to Exhibit H\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>Exhibit I to Exhibit M\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>Exhibit N to Exhibit Y\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>Mini Aquarium\</a\>\</li\>

[]{#_bookmark630 .anchor}*Chapter 13*

> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>Alpha Aviary\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \<li\>\<a href=\"#\"\>Adopt an animal for just \$4\</a\>\</li\>
>
> \</ul\>
>
> \<br\>
>
> \<p\>Welcome to our Zoo! We take pride in the happy animals we
> house.\</p\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> We can use the fade class to fade the content of tabs after viewing
> them:
>
> \<div class=\"tab-content\"\>
>
> \<div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane fade in active\"
> id=\"homepage\"\>\...\</div\>
>
> \<div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane fade\"
> id=\"profile\"\>\...\</div\>
>
> \<div role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"tab-pane fade\"
> id=\"posts\"\>\...\</div\>
>

#### Accordions

> Many a time, we come across scenarios wherein we need to manage large
> amounts of information within a single page. Placing all this content
> on a single page may lead to the creation of a very long page, and
> scrolling up or down may be frustrating for the person using the
> website. Accordion widgets are used to solve this problem, as they are
> used on websites to manage the large amount of content and navigation
> lists. They are basically collapsible panels inside which information
> is placed. With the Bootstrap collapse plugin, its very simple to
> create accordions.
>
> This code creates an accordion with panel components:
>
> \<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion\"\>
>
> \<H1\> Welcome to Alpha Zoo \</H1\>
>
> \<p\>Welcome to our Zoo! We take pride in the happy animals we
> house.\</p\>
>
> \<div class=\"panel panel-default\"\>
>
> \<div class=\"panel-heading\"\>
>
> \<h4 class=\"panel-title\"\>

#### Modals

> Modal plugins are popup windows or boxes that are displayed at the top
> of the page. A modal looks like this:

#### Modal size

> The modal dialog boxes come in two sizes. Small modals can be used for
> dealing with small functions, whereas large modals can be used to
> prompt large datasets.

##### Small {#small-2}

> The modal-dialog modal-sm class creates a small modal. Here is the
> syntax:
>
> \<div class=\"modal-dialog modal-sm\"\>

##### Large

> The modal-dialog modal-lg class creates a large modal. Here is the
> syntax:
>
> \<div class=\"modal-dialog modal-lg\"\>

#### Media objects

> *Chapter 13*
>
> Media objects are abstract object styles that can be used for making
> blog comments or other descriptive thumbnails:

-   .media: This class floats a media object to the right or left of a
    content block

-   .media-list: This class forms an unordered list of items:

> \<div class=\"media\"\>
>
> \<a class=\"pull-left\" href=\"#\"\>
>
> \<img class=\"media-object\" data-src=\"holder.js/64x64\"\>
>
> \</a\>
>
> \<div class=\"media-body\"\>
>
> \<h4 class=\"media-heading\"\>This is the Main Media heading \</h4\>
>

>
> \<!\-- Nested media object \--\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \</li\>
>
> \</ul\>

#### Carousels

> The carousel plugin allows you to make elements move in a circle while
> viewing each element one by one.
>
> Carousels show components by cycling through them. This can be done
> using the following code, which creates a carousel of animal
> photographs:
>
> \<div id=\"myCarousel\" class=\"carousel slide\"
> data-ride=\"carousel\"\>
>
> \<!\-- Indicators \--\>

#### Typehead

> A Typehead is just another form of textbox that provides text
> predictions as the user types into the text box and may look something
> like this if programmed to type ahead the states of the US:

![](./images-ref/media/image132.jpeg)

[]{#_bookmark634 .anchor}*Chapter 13*

#### How to create typehead

> The following code shows how you can create a simple typehead textbox:
>
> \<input type=\"text\" data-provide=\"typeahead\"\>

#### Usage of typehead via JavaScript

> We can call the typehead using the following code:
>
> \$(\'.typeahead\').typeahead()
>
> For a complete implementation, visit
> [https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/](https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/)
> [examples/](https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/).

#### Scrollspy

> The **Scrollspy** plugin allows the navigation targets to
> automatically update themselves when the user scrolls up or down.
>
> Scrollspy can help in identifying the section of the page you have
> reached while scrolling randomly and makes finding required data much
> easier. The Scrollspy plugin can normally be activated in two ways,
> which we will see now.

#### Activating Scrollspy via a data attribute

> The data attribute allows spying on a particular element by adding
> \<data-spy
>
> =\"scroll\" to the element:
>
> \<body data-spy=\"scroll\" data-target=\".navbar\"\>\...\</body\>

#### Activating Scrollspy via JavaScript

> Scrollspy can also be triggered by JavaScript by selecting the element
> and executing the scrollspy() function:
>
> \$(\'#navbar\').scrollspy()

#### Affix

> The **affix** plugin is used to lock an element to an area on a page.
>
> The affix plugin can be activated using data attributes or JavaScript.
> Affix plugins are used to place social icons on websites, where they
> are locked in one place so that they can be accessed by the user any
> time.
>
> []{#_bookmark635 .anchor}*[Bootstrap -- The Stylish CSS Frontend
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### Activating the affix plugin via a data attribute

> Use the following method to activate the affix tool:
>
> \<div data-spy=\"affix\" data-offset-top=\"200\"\>\...\</div\>

#### Activating the affix plugin via JavaScript

> We can also activate the affix tool via JavaScript manually using the
> following code:
>
> \$(\'#navbar\').affix()

## Customizing Bootstrap

> Since Bootstrap is a very heavy project, including all its
> repositories is not actually required, and even if you do, this could
> put enormous load on your website, making it sluggish and affecting
> user experience. To get the Bootstrap engine suited to your specific
> needs, go to <http://getbootstrap.com/customize/> and import a style
> file with the settings you need. You can also import your existing
> settings file on the preceding link, add or remove options within the
> GUI, and get an updated version without writing a single line of code.

## Websites built with Bootstrap

> WordPress is out there, and a lot of big websites and companies are
> using it. Twitter\'s website itself is made with Bootstrap. Take a
> look at some famous websites built with the Bootstrap framework:

# jQuery -- The Popular

JavaScript Library

> jQuery is an open source JavaScript library. jQuery makes JavaScript
> programming much simpler.
>
> The following are the notable corporate members of the jQuery
> foundation:

-   **WordPress**: (<http://wordpress.org/>)

-   **IBM**: (<http://ibm.com/>)

-   **NeoBux**: (<http://www.neobux.com/>)

-   **Mozilla**: (<http://www.mozilla.org/>)

-   **Intel\'s Open Source Technology Center**:

## The evolution of JQuery

> jQuery has been evolving since day one. There are two major releases
> available for download. The versions 1.x and 2.x differ in a way; 1.x
> is more stable and supports older browsers as well; whereas, 2.x has
> the same API as 1.x but without the support for legacy browsers.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image137.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.33658683289588803in"}A legacy browser is an older version of
> a browser that has not been updated to the latest available version.
>
> []{#_bookmark639 .anchor}*[jQuery -- The Popular JavaScript
> Library]{.underline}*
>
> If you are using jQuery for a project, you can get another version
> that takes fewer resources and is faster to load.

## Getting started

> To get started with developing jQuery, you can download jQuery
> software by visiting <https://jquery.com/>. In the following sections,
> we will cover a few download links.

### Installing JQuery

> We can download jQuery from <http://jquery.com/download/>.
>
> There are two versions of jQuery available for download: compressed
> and uncompressed.
>
> To choose your option, go to the preceding link and right-click on
> **Save as** and select
>
> **My Computer** and download it.

#### jQuery 1.x

> We can download the minified version from
> [http://code.jquery.com/jquery-](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js)
> [1.11.3.min.js](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js).
>
> For development, we can download the version 1.x from
> [http://code.jquery.](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.js)
> [com/jquery-1.11.3.js](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.js).

#### jQuery 2.x

> We can download the minified version from
> [http://code.jquery.com/jquery-](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js)
> [2.1.4.min.js](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js).
>
> For development, we can download the version 2.x from
> [http://code.jquery.](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.js)
> [com/jquery-2.1.4.js](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.js).

## Using jQuery

> jQuery is an extremely powerful JavaScript library. Here are a few
> sample pieces of code to give you a head start on your next project.

[]{#_bookmark640 .anchor}*Chapter 14*

> If you have downloaded the jQuery library to your hard disk and plan
> to use it from there, then you can include the following code in your
> HTML \<head\> tag:
>
> \<script src=\"js/jquery.min.js\"\>\</script\>
>
> Here, js is a folder in the root directory of your project.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image138.png){width="0.31994641294838144in"
> height="0.3996522309711286in"}To avoid longer loading time and
> performance issues, scripts should be added to the end of the \<body\>
> tag because when the browser loads the web page (let\'s say,
> sample1.html) and the scripts are
>
> at the end of the body tag, the browser can render the content of the
> page (the body) and only start loading scripts afterward.
>
> Another preferred approach is to use the Google hosted libraries;
> these provide faster rendering to your pages and jQuery code than
> using your own hosted jQuery libraries. You can use the Google
> developer hosted libraries with the following piece of code:
>
> \<script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/
> jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js\"\>
>
> \</script\>
>
> The jQuery syntax is used to perform any specific action on elements
> of HTML.
>
> The basic syntax is as follows:
>
> \$(selector).action()
>
> Here is the description:

-   \$: \$ is used to access the jQuery object.

-   (selector): The query (or find) HTML elements using familiar
    CSS-style selector syntax. For example, you can select by element
    name, type, class or id.

-   jQuery action(): For example, it can be events like click, keypress,
    focus and so on.

## Selectors

> As the name suggests, selector attributes are used to select various
> elements of HTML. The selector attributes basically support the CSS
> selectors.
>
> Selectors begin with a \$ sign followed by parentheses: \$()
>
> []{#_bookmark641 .anchor}*[jQuery -- The Popular JavaScript
> Library]{.underline}*

### Element selectors

> Element selectors select elements using their name. For example, if a
> paragraph is written in the tags \<p\>, you can select this paragraph
> using its name, that is, p:
>
> \$(\"p\")

#### Parameters

> The name of the element to be chosen is passed as a parameter.

#### Returns

> The element selectors returns the element.

#### Description

> The element selectors select elements using their name. For example,
> if a paragraph is written in the tags \<p\>, you can select this
> paragraph using its name.

### ID selectors

> ID selectors select elements using their ID. Each element of the HTML
> can have its own identifying ID and it can be accessed using #. For
> example, to access the element with the ID text, we can use the
> following syntax:
>
> \$(\"#text\")

#### Parameters

> The pound sign (or number sign) or a hash sign followed by the ID name
> is passed as a parameter.

#### Returns

> This returns the element using the ID passed as a parameter.

#### Description

> This selects elements using their ID. IDs are usually used to uniquely
> identify DOM elements that are accessed through the pound symbol in
> Javascript or the hash sign.

### Class selectors

> *Chapter 14*
>
> Class selectors select the elements using the class name. For example,
> a class named sample can be accessed by the following syntax:
>
> \$(\".sample\")

#### Parameters

> A dot/period followed by the name of the class is passed as a
> parameter.

#### Returns

> This returns the elements using the Class name passed as parameter.

#### Description

> This selects the elements using the class name.

## Events

> JQuery makes it easier to response when user interacts with the web
> page. For example, we can perform several tasks when they click
> somewhere, scroll the document, hover on field or anything like that.
> Whenever user interacts with the web page, an event is occurred. We
> can use event handling to execute our code.

### Mouse events

> These are the events that are instantiated as soon as the user
> activates any of the functions related to the mouse. In the following
> sections, we will cover the description of each mouse event.

#### .click()

> The click event takes a DOM object and calls the function if or when
> it is clicked by the user.

##### Parameters

> The click event receives a callback function.

##### Returns

> This returns the response generated by the function called on click.
>
> []{#_bookmark643 .anchor}*[jQuery -- The Popular JavaScript
> Library]{.underline}*

##### Description

> The click event uses the ID to get what the user has clicked on and
> accordingly calls
>
> its respective function defined inside the body.
>
> Here is an example of its usage.

######## HTML Code:

> \<div id=\"clicked\"\>
>
> //function to be called after clicked
>
> \</div\>

######## jQuery Code:

> \$( \"#clicked\" ).click(function() {
>
> alert( \"Function for .click() called.\" );
>
> });

#### .dblclick()

> We can attach a handler to the double-click event of an HTML element
> using the
>
> .dblclick() jQuery method.

##### Parameters

> The dbclick event receives a callback function.

##### Returns

> This returns the response generated by the function called on **double
> click**.

##### Description

> The dblclick event uses the ID to get what the user had double clicked

#### .toggle()

> This .toggle() function is used to bind multiple handlers to matching
> elements that are executed on alternate clicks.

##### Parameters

> The parameters of the toggle() function are duration, easing, and
> callback.
>
> The duration parameter is optional and is used to specify the speed of
> the hide and show effect. The possible values are fast, slow, and
> milliseconds. The default is 400 ms.
>
> The easing parameter is optional and is used to specify the easing()
> function that is to be used for animation. The default value is
> string.
>
> The callback parameter too is optional and is used to specify the
> function that is to be called once the animation is complete.

##### Returns

> This returns the output of the function that is called.

##### Description

> This function is used to check the visibility of an element and then
> alternate between the hide() and show() methods. The callback is
> always fired once the animation is complete and only once for the
> element that finds a match.

### Keyboard events

> The keyboard events are triggered on Keyboard functions, for example,
> when a button/key is pressed or released, and so on. Keyboard events
> can be controlled with the following built-in jQuery functions. The
> available functions are KeyDown, KeyPress, and KeyUp.
>
> The only practical difference between KeyDown and KeyPress is that
> KeyPress relays the character resulting from a KeyPress event and is
> only called if there is one.
>
> For example, if you press *A* on your keyboard, you\'ll get this
> sequence of events:

-   KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.A, KeyData=Keys.A, Modifiers=Keys.None

-   KeyPress: KeyChar=\'a\'

-   KeyUp: KeyCode=Keys.A

#### .keydown()

> The keydown event is instantiated when a key is pressed by the user.

>
> \$( \"#myImage\" ).slideUp( \"fast\", function() {
>
> // Animation complete.
>
> });
>
> });

#### slideToggle()

> The slideToggle() function toggles between slideUp() and slideDown()
> for the
>
> selected element with the specified speed.
>
> Here is an example of its syntax:
>
> \$(selector).slideToggle(speed,callback);

##### Parameters

> This takes speed in milliseconds and the callback function as
> parameters. The values taken as parameters are as follows:

-   Fast

-   Slow

-   Time in milliseconds

##### Returns

> This does not return anything.
>
> []{#_bookmark671 .anchor}*[jQuery -- The Popular JavaScript

##### Description

> Just as fadeToggle() switches transitions between two states,
> slideToggle() can slide an element up or down.
>
> Here is an example of its usage. Required HTML Code:
>
> \<div id=\"sample\"\> Click here
>
> \</div\>
>
> \<img id=\"myImage\" src=\"myImage.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\"

> });

## Callback

> Multiple lines of statements are queued rather than being executed
> simultaneously. A callback function queues the statements and executes
> them one by one.
>
> Its syntax is as follows:
>
> var callbacks = \$.Callbacks();
>
> The object created can be used to add, remove, instantiate, and
> disable callbacks. The supported functions are callbacks.add(),
> callbacks.remove(), callbacks. fire(), and callbacks.disable().

### callbacks.add()

> This function is used to add all the functions in an array that are to
> be called later.

#### Parameters

> This takes flags as strings as its parameters.

#### Returns

> *Chapter 14*
>
> This method returns the callback\'s object to which it is associated
> with, (this).

#### Description

> The callbacks.add() function adds the function to the callback array.
> Here is an example of its usage.
>
> Required jQuery Code:
>
> function myFunc1( value ) { console.myLog( value );
>
> }
>
> function myFunc2( value ) {
>
> console.myLog( \"myFunc2 says: \" + value ); return false;
>
> }
>
> var callbacks = \$.Callbacks(); callbacks.add( myFunc1 );
>
> // Outputs: meow! callbacks.fire( \"meow!\" );
>
> callbacks.add( myFunc2 );
>
> // Outputs: woof!, myFunc2 says: woof! callbacks.fire( \"woof!\" );

### callbacks.fire()

> The callbacks.fire() function invokes the callbacks in a list with any
> arguments that have been passed.

#### Parameters

> This takes a list of arguments to pass back to the callback list.
>
> []{#_bookmark673 .anchor}*[jQuery -- The Popular JavaScript
> Library]{.underline}*

#### Returns

> This returns the callback objects onto which it is attached.

#### Description

> The callbacks.fire() function is used to invoke the callbacks in a
> list with the arguments. The preceding example could be referenced.

### callbacks.remove()

> The callbacks.remove() function is used to remove a function from the
> array.

#### Parameters

> This takes flags as strings as its parameters.

#### Returns

> This returns the callbacks object onto which it is attached.

#### Description

> This removes the function from the callback array. The preceding
> example could be referenced.

### callbacks.disable()

> The callbacks.disable() function disables the call of the next
> function in the array.

#### Parameters

> This does not take any parameter.

#### Returns

> This returns the callbacks object to which the object is attached.

#### Description

> *Chapter 14*
>
> The execution of the next function in the array is prevented using the
> callbacks. disable() function:
>
> var sound = function( value ) { console.log( value );
>
> };
>
> var callbacks = \$.Callbacks();
>
> // Add the above function to the list callbacks.add( sound );
>
> // Fire the items on the list callbacks.fire( \"Woof!\" );
>
> // Disable further calls being possible callbacks.disable();
>
> callbacks.fire( \"Meow\" );

## Chaining

> A varying amount of statements can be executed by chaining them on the
> same element. Each statement will be executed one after the other.
>
> The value returned from each chained action is a new jQuery object.
> Chaining can be done by appending one action to the previous action;
> for example:
>
> \$(\"#p1\").css(\"color\", \"blue\").slideDown(100).slideUp(35);
>
> Here, the actions slideUp() and slideDown() are performed one after
> the other.

## jQuery and the document object model

> The DOM defines a standard for accessing HTML and XML documents:
>
> *\"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and
> language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to
> dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a
> document.\"*
>
> []{#_bookmark675 .anchor}*[jQuery -- The Popular JavaScript
> Library]{.underline}*
>
> The following are some ways of DOM manipulation in jQuery:

-   text(): This sets or returns the text content of the selected
    elements

-   html(): This sets or returns the content of the selected elements

-   val(): This sets or returns the values of form fields

## jQuery traversing

> You can traverse through the elements in the order they are combined.
> All the elements are mostly combined in the form of a tree, and we can
> traverse them starting from the root.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image140.png){width="0.4178423009623797in"
> height="0.3365758967629046in"}Elements are not *combined* per se, but
> they are rather structured or modeled within the document object.
>
> Let\'s take a look at the following image:

![](./images-ref/media/image141.png)

> Let\'s take a look at the following description:

-   The \<div\> element is the parent of \<ul\> and an ancestor of
    everything inside it

-   The \<ul\> element is the parent of both the \<li\> elements and a
    child of \<div\>

-   The left \<li\> element is the parent of \<span\>, child of \<ul\>,
    and a descendant of \<div\>

-   The \<span\> element is a child of the left \<li\> and a descendant
    of \<ul\>

> and \<div\>

-   The two \<li\> elements are siblings (they share the same parent)

-   The right \<li\> element is the parent of \<b\>, child of \<ul\>,
    and a descendant of \<div\>

-   The \<b\> element is a child of the right \<li\> and a descendant of
    \<ul\> and \<div\>

> mentioned condition, not() can be used.

## Using AJAX in jQuery

> **Asynchronous JavaScript and XML** (**AJAX**) was the base building
> block of **Single Page Applications** (**SPAs**). This method is used
> to update the content of a web page without reloading the whole page.
> This method helps save precious resources and decreases the time taken
> for loading a page considerably, since only parts of the page are
> reloaded and not the entire page.
>
> More than often, you have visited the Google search page for searching
> answers to your questions. Have you noticed how the page displays
> results as you type into the search box and provides useful
> suggestions of related searches? Or the product filters on Amazon and
> Ebay websites. These effects are achieved with AJAX.

### The jQuery Ajax load

> The load() method loads data from a server and puts the returned data
> into the selected element.
>
> Its syntax is as follows:
>
> \$(selector).load(URL,data,callback);
>
> []{#_bookmark685 .anchor}*[jQuery -- The Popular JavaScript
> Library]{.underline}*

##### Parameters

> The load() method take the URL, data, and callback as parameters. The
> callback parameter can have the following parameters:

-   responseTxt: This parameter contains the resulting content when
    successful

-   statusTxt: This parameter contains the status of the request, that
    is,

> success, notmodified, error, timeout, parsererror

-   xhr: This parameter contains the XMLHttpRequest object

##### Returns

> The data from the URL is placed in the selected element.

##### Description

> The load() method loads data from a server and puts the returned data
> into the selected element. The following example loads the Sample.txt
> file into the specified
>
> \<div\> tag:
>
> \$(\"#div1\").load(\"Sample.txt\" , function(responseTxt, statusTxt,
> xhr);

### jQuery Ajax Get

> The Get request gets the data from the server with an HTTP GET
> request:

-   GET: This requests data from a specified resource Its syntax is as
    follows:

> \$.get(URL,callback);

#### Parameters

> This takes the URL and callback as parameters. Here the callback
> parameter is optional.

#### Returns

> The Get request returns the data fetched from the URL.

[]{#_bookmark686 .anchor}*Chapter 14*

#### Description

> The Get request gets the data from the server with an HTTP GET
> request:
>
> \$.get(\"Sample.html\", myfunction(data)
>
> The required HTML file is as follows:
>
> \<p\> This is the data from the Sample.html file\</p\>
>
> The preceding code will fetch the data from the html file and the line
> **This is the data from the Sample.html** will be displayed in an
> alert box on triggering.

### jQuery Ajax Post

> The Post request gets data from the server with an HTTP POST request:

-   POST: This requests data from a specified resource Its syntax is as
    follows:

> \$.post(URL, data, callback);

#### Parameters

> This takes URL, data, and callback as parameters. Here, the data and

## Miscellaneous jQuery functions

> Here are a few more jQuery functions.

### noConflict()

> Different scripts cannot work at the same time. Hence, in order to
> remove the
>
> conflicts, we use the noConflict() function. Its syntax is as follows:
>
> \$.noConflict()

#### Parameters

> An optional parameter for this method is removeAll. This parameter is
> used to release the control over all jQuery variables. It\'s a Boolean
> value. If present, it indicates that the control over all values must
> be released.

#### Returns

> This method does not return anything.

#### Description

> The \$ symbol is used by various JavaScript libraries, which if used
> alongside jQuery may cause issues. The noConflict() function returns
> the control of the \$ symbol to the other library.
>
> The following code shows how one event has to wait when the other
> event is in process:
>
> \$.noConflict(); jQuery(document).ready(function() {
>
> jQuery(\"button\").click(function() { jQuery(\"p\").text(\"jQuery is
> still working!\");
>
> });
>
> });

### param() {#param-2}

> The param() method is used to create a serialized representation of an
> object. Its syntax is as follows:
>
> \$.param(object)

#### Parameters

> *Chapter 14*
>
> Object and trad are the parameters used in this function. Trad is an
> optional parameter and is used when a traditional param serialization
> is needed. This parameter is optional.

#### Returns

> This returns a serialized representation of the object.

#### Description

> The param() method is used to generate a serialized representation of
> an object or an array. This is mostly used where a query string is to
> be generated. The following example creates a query string for the
> student object:
>
> \$(document).ready(function() { StudentObj = new Object();
> StudentObj.name = \"Kate\"; StudentObj.age = 21;
>
> StudentObj.class = \"Micro-Processors\";
>
> \$(\"button\").click(function() {
>
> \$(\"div\").text(\$.param(StudentObj));
>
> });
>
> });

### index()

> The index() method is used to find out the position of an element. Its
> syntax is as follows:
>
> \$(selector).index()

#### Parameters

> The element whose position is to be found is taken as a parameter.

#### Returns

> This method returns the index position of the first occurrence of the
> specified element, which is relative to the selector or specified
> element.
>
> []{#_bookmark689 .anchor}*[jQuery -- The Popular JavaScript
> Library]{.underline}*

#### Description

> The index() method is used to get the position of the element that is
> passed as a parameter. The first occurrence of that element is
> searched for and its position is returned. If the particular element
> is not found, then -1 is returned. The position numbering begins at 0.
>
> The following example finds the position of the div element and
> returns its index in an alert box:
>
> \$(document).ready(myfunction() {
>
> \$(\"div\").click(myfunction() {
>
> alert(\$(this).index());
>
> });
>
> });

### each()

> The each() function is used to run a specific function for every
> element that matches the criteria.
>
> Its syntax is as follows:
>
> \$(selector).each(function(index,element))

#### Parameters

> The only parameter this takes is the function(index, element). Here
> the position
>
> of the selector can be specified at index and the element can be
> specified in element.

#### Returns

> This method does not return anything.

#### Description

> The each() function runs the specified function for each and every
> element that
>
> matches the criteria. In the following example, an alert is created
> every time the
>
> \<div\> tag is encountered:
>
> \$(document).ready(function() {
>
> \$(\"button\").click(function() {
>
> \$(\"div\").each(function() {
>
> alert(\$(this).text())
>
> });
>
> });
>
> });

### data()

> *Chapter 14*

> is also used to submit data to the selected element.
>
> Its syntax is as follows: \$(selector).data(name)

#### Parameters

> \$(selector).data(name,value);
>
> To attach data to element, parameters passed are name and value. that
> name is then used to retrieve the data value.

#### Returns

> This returns data from the selected element.

#### Description

> The data() function is used to attach data to or from an element. In
> the following
>
> example, we first attach the data to the \<div\> element:
>
> \$(document).ready(function() {
>
> \$(\"#btnAttach\").click(function() {
>
> \$(\"div\").data(\"greetingmsg\", \"Welcome To Alpha Zoo\");
>
> });
>
> \$(\"#btnGetAttached\").click(function() {

>
> []{#_bookmark691 .anchor}*[jQuery -- The Popular JavaScript
> Library]{.underline}*

#### Returns

> This does not return anything.

#### Description

> As the name suggests, the removeData() method is used to remove data
> that was already set. The following example removes data that was set
> on the \<div\> tag:
>
> \$(\"#btnRemoveData\").click(function() {
>
> \$(\"div\").removeData(\"greetingmsg\");
>
> alert(\"Message from the site\" + \$(\"div\").data(\"greetingmsg\"));
>
> });

# AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand Framework

> Angular is an application framework that helps you create web
> applications. It builds off of HTML and JavaScript to make the
> creation of dynamic applications easier. Angular extends and is a
> superset of JavaScript at the same time. You can use plain old
> JavaScript and Angular to build your application.
>
> This creates a double-edged sword. On the positive side, it is much
> easier to build dynamic user interfaces and keep your code
> maintainable and testable. On the other side, you must learn the
> overall concept of how an Angular application is built, which Angular
> piece goes where. This is very different to any other JavaScript
> application you may have built.
>
> If all you have ever built is user interfaces with **jQuery**,
> **BackBone**, or plain old JavaScript, then much of Angular will seem
> new and different.
>
> We will try to cover Angular in a hierarchical way. We will start at
> the top with containers that hold other parts and objects and end
> functions that can be used across many objects. We will also touch
> upon testing, as it is a core part of how Angular is built.
>
> Let\'s not waste any more time and jump right to it.
>
> All of the examples assume that you have loaded Angular so that the
> angular
>
> object is available.

## Modules (ngApp)

> This is the high-level container for all the other parts of your
> application. There are more functions than those listed here, but they
> will be described in the section they relate to. For example, you can
> use module.controller to create a controller, but this function will
> be under the controller section.

### module {#module-1}

> Modules are the first basic building block of an Angular application:
>
> angular.module(moduleName, \[dependencies\], \[configFunction\])
> angular.module(moduleName)

#### Parameters

-   moduleName: This is a string that will identify the module. It
    should be unique.

-   dependencies(optional): This is an array of module names that this
    module is dependent on.

-   configFunction(optional): This is a function that will configure the
    module. See *config* section.

#### Return value

> This is an Angular module object.

#### Description

> This function will either create a new module or retrieve a module.
> This depends on whether we pass in an array of dependencies. If
> dependencies are omitted, then a module is retrieved. Conversely, if
> we include an array of modules to load (the array can also be empty),
> then a module will be created.
>
> When you have a group of objects that work together, it is a good idea
> to put them into a module. Do not worry about creating too many
> modules. A module should have one and only one clear function. Then,
> all the objects that it needs to accomplish that function would be
> packaged with it.

[]{#_bookmark695 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

> Here are a few examples of creating modules:

-   This creates a new module: var firstModule = angular.
    module(\'firstModule\', \[\]);

-   This retrieves a module named firstModule: var firstModule =
    angular.module(\'firstModule\');

-   This creates a module that relies on firstModule: var secondModule =
    angular.module(\'secondModule\', \[\'firstModule\'\]);

### config {#config-1}

> This allows you to configure providers:
>
> module.config(configFunction)

#### Parameters

-   The configFunction function is the function that will be executed.

#### Return value

> This is an Angular module object.

#### Description

> This is the function that should be used to configure providers. We
> will cover providers later in this chapter, but there are a few
> examples in this section. This allows for providers to be created
> before the module actually executes.
>
> The providers will be injected into this function when called. For
> example, you can use \$provide or \$routeProvider and they will be
> available. If you want to use a custom provider, it would have to be
> created before config. The custom object will need provider appended
> to the name for it to be available in config.
>
> Here are a couple of examples using providers:

-   This example uses \$provide. The provider will be available later as

> firstProvider:
>
> firstModule.config(function (\$provide) {
>
> \$provide.provider(\'firstProvider\', function () { this.\$get =
> function () {
>
> return function () { alert(\'First!\'); }

}

});

> });
>
> []{#_bookmark696 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

-   This example creates a provider first. It is injected as
    firstProvider in

> config and used later:
>
> firstModule.provider(\'first\', function () { this.\$get = function ()
> {
>
> return function () { alert(\'First!\'); }

}

});

> firstModule.config(function (firstProvider) {
> console.log(firstProvider);
>
> });

### run {#run}

> This function is executed after config:
>
> module.run(runFunction)

#### Parameters

-   The runFunction function is the function that will be executed.

#### Return value

> This is an Angular module object.

#### Description

> The run() function gets executed after config. At this point, all
> modules will be loaded. It is the first function called after the
> module is initialized after config. What you do in this function will
> depend on the module.
>
> Here is an example that sets a scope variable. The variable will be
> available in the module in later functions:
>
> firstModule.run(function (\$rootScope) {
>
> \$rootScope.test = \'test\';
>
> });

## Routing (ngRoute)

> *Chapter 15*
>
> The ngRoute module is a module that will allow you to configure
> routing in your application. Routing is listening for changes to the
> location and then automatically responding to those changes with a new
> controller and template. It uses ngView,
>
> \$routeProvider, and \$route.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image145.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.33658683289588803in"}Your module will need to depend on
> ngRoute to use these directives and services. We will also need to
> include the Angular route JavaScript in our HTML.

### ngView

> This works with the \$route service as a spot for content:
>
> \<ng-view \[onload=\'\'\] \[autoscroll=\'\'\]/\>
>
> \<element ng-view \[onload=\'\'\] \[autoscroll=\'\'\]/\>

#### Parameters

-   onload(Angular expression): This evaluates on load.

-   autoscroll(Angular expression): Whether or not \$anchorScroll is
    used with this ngView. By default, it is disabled. Otherwise, it
    will evaluate whether the expression is true or not.

#### Return value

> This is a directive.

#### Description

> When routing, you will need to mark a part of your application where
> dynamic content can be loaded. This is what ngView does. When a route
> is matched, it will load the new content where ngView is. An example
> will be provided for all of ngRoute at the end of the section.

### \$routeProvider

> This is a provider that lets you configure routes:
>
> \$routeProvider.when(path, route)
>
> \$routeProvider.otherwise(route)
>
> []{#_bookmark698 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### Parameters

-   path(string): This is what the location will be matched against. It
    can contain named groups by using a colon (:group), can include a
    star to match multiple parts (:group\*), and can be optional
    (:group?).

-   route(object): This object tells Angular what to do when the route
    matches. The object can have these properties (not an inclusive
    list):

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   controller

-   template

-   templateUrl

-   resolve

#### Return value

> This returns \$routeProvider, so it is chainable.

#### Description

> This is the provider that can be used to configure all of the routes.
> It can be injected
>
> into module.config.

### \$route

> This is the actual service that provides which route definition has
> been matched. This is an object that can be injected directly into a
> controller.

#### Properties

-   current(object): This object has the current variables based on the
    route that was matched. This will include \$route,
    loadedTemplateUrl, locals, params, and scope.

-   routes(object): This has all the routes configured.

#### Events

> These events can be listened for the \$route object:

-   \$routeChangeStart: This event is fired before the actual route
    change

-   \$routeChangeSuccess: This event is fired after a route has been
    resolved

-   \$routeChangeError: This event is fired if any of the route promises
    are rejected

#### Description

> *Chapter 15*
>
> This is a service that can be injected into each controller. The
> controller can then look at the properties to get information about
> the route that was matched. The routing matching will happen without
> your intervention and then you can update your controller\'s scope
> when the route is loaded.

### \$routeParams

> This is a service that will return the parameters of the loaded route.
> This will only give you parameters after a route has resolved, so you
> may need to use
>
> \$route.current.params. This can be injected into a controller.
>
> Here is an example using all of the directives and services in
> ngRoute. First, we have an HTML body tag. This will also include an
> inline template named main.html. This template will echo out the
> \$route and \$routeParams objects:
>
> \<body ng-app=\"firstModule\"\>
>
> \<div ng-view\>\</div\>
>
> \<a href=\"#/main/1\"\>Main\</a\>
>
> \<script type=\"text/ng-template\" id=\"main.html\"\>
>
> \<pre\>\$routeParams = {{\$routeParams}}\</pre\>
>
> \<pre\>\$route = {{\$route}}\</pre\>
>
> \</script\>
>
> \</body\>
>
> Here is the script that will execute this. First is the creation of
> the module, then the configuration of \$routeProvider and, finally,
> the definition of a controller for the provider to use:
>
> var firstModule = angular.module(\'firstModule\', \[\'ngRoute\'\]);
>
> firstModule.config(function (\$routeProvider) {
>
> \$routeProvider.when(\'/main/:id\', { controller: \'MainController\',
> templateUrl: \'main.html\'
>
> });
>
> });
>
> firstModule.controller(\'MainController\', function (\$scope, \$route,
>
> \$routeParams) {
>
> \$scope.\$route = \$route;
>
> \$scope.\$routeParams = \$routeParams;
>
> });

## Dependency injection

> Angular makes use of dependency injection everywhere. Dependency
> injection is when a function does not initialize the dependencies it
> needs. Instead, they are
>
> injected into the function as parameters. For example, when a module
> needs a route provider, it asks for one. The module does not care how
> or when the route provider was created; it just wants a reference.
>
> You actually use the injector in everything you do in Angular. Angular
> just does it for you. We will look at \$injector and understand how it
> works but, most likely, you will not need to use these functions.

### Dependency injection in Angular

> We will quickly cover the common ways that objects are injected into
> functions in Angular. Using a controller as an example, we will cover
> the two most common methods. Both of these are using Angular\'s
> injection behind the scenes:

-   **Defining the variables in a function**: You just have to pass the
    name of the object you need injected. Here is an example that uses
    \$scope and a service:

> firstModule.controller(\'DIController\', function (\$scope,
> customService) {
>
> //\$scope and customService are available here console.log(\$scope);
> console.log(customService);
>
> });

-   **Using an array to list the dependencies**: You can get the exact
    same result using an array. The elements of the array will be the
    objects you need as strings. Finally, you will just need to have a
    function as the last element in the array. The function can even
    rename the variable if needed. Here is the same example in the array
    format:

> firstModule.controller(\'DIController\', \[\'\$scope\',
> \'customService\', function (newScope, custom) {
>
> // newScope and custom are available here console.log(newScope);
> console.log(custom);
>
> }\]);
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image146.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.336580271216098in"}Only the array format is minification
> safe. The first function will not work once the source has been
> minified.

[]{#_bookmark701 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

### injector {#injector-1}

> Use this to get an Angular injector that you can invoke:
>
> angular.injector(modules)

#### Parameters

-   The modules(array) array is a list of the modules you want to load.
    You must include ng.

#### Return value

> This returns an injector object. See \$injector section.

#### Description

> You can create this object to use Angular\'s injector object. List out
> the references you want and then invoke your function.
>
> Here is an example that gets a reference to the \$http service:
>
> var injector = angular.injector(\[\'ng\'\]);
>
> var injectTest = function (\$http) { console.log(\$http); };
> injector.invoke(injectTest);

### \$injector {#injector-2}

> You will very rarely ever need to create an injector in Angular. It
> will be provided for you. You can get a reference to the injector by
> injecting it or retrieving it from a current module. Here are examples
> for both:

-   You can get a reference from any element inside of the module:

> var injector = angular.element(document.body).injector();

-   You can have it injected into a function. Here is an example using
    config:

> firstModule.config(function (\$routeProvider, \$injector) {
> console.log(\$injector);
>
> });
>
> []{#_bookmark702 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### Methods

-   annotation: This returns an array of the objects that will be
    injected

-   get(name): This returns the service with its name

-   invoke(function): This will execute the function injecting the
    dependencies

-   has(name): This allows you to determine whether a service exists

#### Description

> Angular will do this automatically for you, but it is always good to
> have an idea of what is happening. This is especially true with
> something that works just like
>
> \$injector. Each time a function executes with dependencies, Angular
> will invoke the function from the injector, sending the correct
> parameters if they have been created and registered.

## Controllers

> Controllers are one of the core units of any Angular application.
> Controllers are used to create a small part of a module that requires
> its own scope. Each module can have many controllers. Controllers
> should be small and focused on one task.
>
> Each controller should really only worry about the data and any events
> that modify that data. This means a controller should not modify the
> DOM, change output or input, or share state with another controller.
> Each of these should use the Angular solution, directives or filters,
> and services, respectively.
>
> Controllers are created from a module reference, so they are tied to
> modules. Here is an example of creating a simple controller:
>
> firstModule.controller(\'SimpleController\', \[\'\$scope\', function
> (\$scope) {
>
> \$scope.hey = \"HEY!\"; console.log(\$scope);
>
> }\]);
>
> This module can then be attached to a DOM element with ngController:
>
> \<div ng-controller=\"SimpleController\"\>
>
> {{ hey }}
>
> \</div\>

### ngController

> *Chapter 15*
>
> This is a core part of how Angular maps to the model-view-controller
> pattern.
>
> \<element ng-controller /\>

#### Parameters

-   The ng-controller(expression) attribute is a string that will tell
    Angular which controller is tied to this element.

#### Description

> A controller needs a part of the document to attach. This directive
> will bind the controller, with its scope, to this element.
>
> If a controller has been defined in a route, then you should not add
> this directive to
>
> the page. The router will take care of binding to the correct element.
>
> Here is an example of using ngcontroller to create an alias for the
> controller:
>
> \<div ng-controller=\"SimpleController as simple\"\>
>
> {{ simple.hey }}
>
> \</div\>

### \$scope {#scope-2}

> This is the most important part of a controller. This is the where you
> should place everything you are tracking for this controller. This
> includes any functions that modify the scope.
>
> The \$scope controller is injected into the controller by declaring a
> dependency to it (see dependency injection). There are built-in
> functions and properties (see Scopes), but because it is just a
> JavaScript object, you can add your own functions and properties.
> These will map directly to the template in the controller.
>
> Here is an example of a controller that defines one property, hey, and
> a function, changeHey. It is important to note that there are no
> references to DOM references at all in this function:
>
> firstModule.controller(\'SimpleController\', \[\'\$scope\', function
> (\$scope) {
>
> \$scope.hey = \"HEY!\";
>
> \$scope.changeHey = function () {
>
> \$scope.hey = \$scope.hey === \'HEY!\' ? \'OK!\' : \'HEY!\';

};

}\]);

> []{#_bookmark704 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*
>
> Here is the template with all the data binding in the HTML document:
>
> \<div ng-controller=\"SimpleController\"\>
>
> {{ hey }}
>
> \<input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"hey\"/\>
>
> \<button ng-click=\"changeHey()\"\>{{hey}}\</button\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> Angular will know what hey is in this element because it is scoped to
> just
>
> SimpleController.

### Data binding and templates

> A controller uses HTML as its templating language. You can bind a
> value from the controller\'s scope just by surrounding it in double
> brackets ({{ }}). That is really all there is to it!
>
> For some elements such as input, select, and textarea, you cannot just
> add the value of a scope object to bind them. You will have to use the
> ngModel directive.
>
> The \$scope section has a great example of binding scope values to the
> template.

### Event binding

> Angular uses directives to bind events. In the \$scope section, the
> example uses
>
> ngClick to listen for the click event on a button.
>
> See the *Directives*, *Event Binding* section for a list of the most
> used event directives.

## Scope {#scope-3}

> The \$scope object that gets injected into controllers has some
> functionality. In addition to this, we will look at the hierarchies
> and digest cycle of scopes.

### Digest cycle

> This is an important concept to understand with scopes. The digest
> cycle, from a high level, is a cycle that checks to see whether any
> scope variables have been changed. If they have, it then executes a
> function. Take binding a scope variable to the template with
> {{variable}}. The digest cycle will now watch this variable and,
> anytime it changes, it will update the template. If the variable is
> bound anywhere else, it will be updated as well. This is how Angular
> \"magically\" makes values auto update.

[]{#_bookmark705 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

> A few things to keep in mind is that not everything in the scope is
> watched. The easiest way to have it watched is to bind it. You can
> also manually watch values. Also, remember that performance issues can
> arise when you are watching many variables. The digest cycle goes
> through all the watchers.

### \$digest

> This is how you can start the digest cycle:
>
> scope.\$digest()

#### Description

> This will manually kick off the digest cycle for the scope. In most
> cases, this does not need to be called. For example, \$digest does not
> need to be called after updating
>
> a value from a click event when handled through Angular. Angular will
> start the digest cycle for you. A good rule of thumb is that if you
> are changing or updating a value from an Angular event or directive in
> a controller, you would not need to call
>
> \$digest.
>
> One case where you may need to call it is when dealing with an
> asynchronous call in a custom directive.

### \$watch

> This allows you to watch a value or computed value in the digest
> cycle:
>
> scope.\$watch(watch, listener)

#### Parameters

-   watch(string or function): This is what you want to watch. A string
    will be evaluated as an expression. The function will have access to
    the scope through the first parameter. Using a function allows you
    to watch not only for values, but also calculated values of
    variables in the scope.

-   listener(function): This function will have the function(newVal,
    oldVal, scope) signature. This is the function that will execute
    when the value changes.

#### Return value

> This is a function to deregister the watch.
>
> []{#_bookmark706 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### Description

> This is how to manually add a watch to the digest cycle. There are two
> main reasons to do this. The first is that you will need to run a
> custom function when a value changes. The other is that you will need
> to watch a combination or calculation of a value in \$scope.
>
> Here is an example that has a watch for a string and a function. The
> basis of the example is from *Controllers*, *\$scope* sections. The
> first watch listens for the hey variable in the scope. The other one
> watches to see whether the value of hey has three or more characters.
> It will only fire when this threshold has been crossed and not fire
> again until it is crossed in the opposite direction:
>
> \$scope.\$watch(\'hey\', function (newVal, oldVal, scope) {
> alert(\'Hey was changed from \' + oldVal + \' to \' + newVal);
>
> });
>
> \$scope.\$watch(function (scope) { return scope.hey.length \>= 3;
>
> }, function (newVal, oldVal, scope) { console.log(\'Hey listener\');
>
> });

### \$apply

> This is a way to manually start the digest cycle:
>
> scope.\$apply(func)

#### Parameters

-   The func(function or string) attribute is a string, it would be
    evaluated as an expression. If it is a function, the function would
    be executed.

#### Return value

> This is the return value of the function or expression.

#### Description

> *Chapter 15*
>
> This will manually kick off the digest cycle. Much like \$digest, this
> should not be called for the most part, except for specific
> situations. The most common situation is when a scope value has been
> changed outside of Angular, for example, an asynchronous AJAX call
> that has a reference to a scope value. The update happens outside of
> the digest loop and Angular does not know as it did not use any
> Angular methods.
>
> This leads to a best practice to always use Angular\'s services and
> functions. If you do so, you should never have to run \$apply.
>
> Another best practice is to run your function inside \$apply. Angular
> will catch any errors that are thrown and you can deal with them the
> Angular way.
>
> Here is an example that updates the scope inside setTimeout after 2
> seconds. As the
>
> digest loop has finished, it will not see this change unless \$apply
> is called:
>
> setTimeout(function () {
>
> \$scope.\$apply(function () { \$scope.hey = \'Updated from
> setTimeout\'; });
>
> }, 2000);

### Hierarchies

> Angular applications only have one root scope but many child scopes.
> When a variable is referenced, it will check the current scope it is
> in and then check the parent. This will happen all the way up to the
> root scope. This is very similar to how JavaScript objects work with
> the prototype property. You can find more about this in *Chapter 8*,
> *JavaScript Object-orientated Programming*.

## Services

> The role services play in an Angular application is clear, but there
> can be confusion around the creation of services. This is because
> there are three very similar ways to create a service in Angular. We
> will look at each of these and why they should be used.
>
> A service in Angular is an object that can be an authority on data
> (meaning it is the only source of some data). A great example is the
> route provider as it is the only object that provides route
> information. It is a singleton that all modules utilize, a way to keep
> data in sync between controllers, or all of these! A great example of
> a service that you will most likely need is \$http. It makes AJAX
> requests for you. You can build a service that returns data from your
> API and you do not have to worry about creating AJAX calls in each and
> every controller.
>
> []{#_bookmark708 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*
>
> Another example is the \$route and \$routeParams services. When you
> have a reference to the \$route service, you can always find out what
> route has been matched. The \$routeParams service will let you know
> the parameters.
>
> Services should be used anytime you have the need to write the same
> code more than once. You can pull it out and put it into a service. In
> addition to this, services should be created for any data that will be
> used by more than one controller. The controller can then ask the
> service for the data. This will keep this data the same across
> multiple controllers.
>
> All of the functions listed can be called from the module or off the
> \$provide
>
> injectable object.
>
> Factory, service, and provider will all rely on an HTML template of
> this:
>
> \<div ng-controller=\"SimpleController\"\>
>
> {{ service }}
>
> \</div\>

### Factory

> This is the method to create factories:
>
> module.factory(name, getFunction)

#### Parameters

-   name(string): This is the name that the service will be known by.
    This can be used for dependency injection.

-   getFunction(function or array): This is the function that will
    return the service. This can also be an array that lists the
    dependencies.

#### Return value

> This is an Angular module object.

#### Description

> The service factory is great when you need a singleton. No
> configuration other than what is done in the factory() function is
> done. The object will be the same each time it is injected.

[]{#_bookmark709 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

> Here is a simple example that will return the name of the service. The

};

}\]);

### Service

> Services can be initialized with new keyword:
>
> module.service(name, constructor)

#### Parameters

-   name(string): This is the name of the service

-   constructor(function or array): This will be the function that is
    called as the constructor

#### Return value

> This is an Angular module object.

#### Description

> The key distinction between a service and a factory is that it can be
> initialized with
>
> new. Here is an example that depends on \$http:
>
> firstModule.service(\'firstService\', \[\'\$http\', function (\$http)
> { return function (name) {
>
> var serviceName = name;
>
> this.getName = function () { return serviceName;
>
> };

};

}\]);

> []{#_bookmark710 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*
>
> Here is the controller that will initialize the service:
>
> firstModule.controller(\'SimpleController\', \[\'\$scope\',
> \'firstService\', function (\$scope, firstService) {
>
> var first = new firstService(\'First Service Name\'); var second = new
> firstService(\'Second Service Name\');
>
> \$scope.service = second.getName();
>
> }\]);

### Provider

> The function that provides the most control of the setup of a
> provider:
>
> module.provider(name, provider)

#### Parameters

-   name(string): This is the name of the provider

-   provider(function or array)

#### Return value

> This is an Angular module object.

#### Description

> This is the final and most complex way to build a service. It must
> return an object with a \$get method. You should use this when you
> must have this object ready for configuration. This is the only
> provider that can be injected during the
>
> configuration phase of application startup. The word \"provider\" will
> be appended to the name of this. For example, if you named your
> provider my, it will be injected using myProvider. Here is an example
> provider that has its name injected during configuration. First up is
> the provider definition:
>
> firstModule.provider(\'first\', function () { var serviceName;
>
> return {
>
> configSet: function (name) { serviceName = name;
>
> },
>
> \$get: function () { return {

[]{#_bookmark711 .anchor}}

});

> getName: function () { return serviceName; }
>
> };
>
> }
>
> *Chapter 15*
>
> Next is the configuration. Notice how it is injected using
> firstProvider:
>
> firstModule.config(\[\'firstProvider\', function (firstProvider) {
> firstProvider.configSet(\'firstProvider123\');
>
> }\]);
>
> Finally, here is the controller:
>
> firstModule.controller(\'SimpleController\', \[\'\$scope\', \'first\',
> function (\$scope, firstProvider) {
>
> \$scope.test = firstProvider.getName();
>
> }\]);

### Value {#value-2}

> This sets a value in the module:
>
> module.value(name, value)

#### Parameters

-   name(string): This is the name of the value

-   value(object): This can be anything

#### Return value

> This is an Angular module object.

#### Description

> A value is something that is set and then can be injected later.
> Values can only be injected into a controller or service, not during
> configuration.
>
> Here is a simple example of value:
>
> firstModule.value(\'appTitle\', \'First App\');
>
> []{#_bookmark712 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

### Constant

> This creates a constant variable in a module:
>
> module.constant(name, value)

#### Parameters

-   name(string): This is the name of the value

-   value(object): This can be anything

#### Return value

> This is an Angular module object.

#### Description

> This is very similar to value, except that this can be used in the
> config function and that the value cannot be decorated.
>
> Here is a simple example of constant:
>
> firstModule.constant(\'appTitle\', \'First App\');

### \$http

> This is the service used to make HTTP calls:
>
> \$http(config)

#### Parameters

-   config(object): This object has the following properties:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   method(string): This is the HTTP method.

-   url(string): This is the URL.

-   params(string or object): This is the params for the request. An
    object will be mapped key to value for this.

-   data(string or object): This is the data to be sent in the request.

-   headers(object): This sets the headers for the request.

-   xsrfHeadername(string): This is the name of the header for XSRF.

-   xsrfCookieName(string): This is the name of the cookie for XSRF.

[]{#_bookmark713 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

-   cache(Boolean): This is used to decide whether to cache data or not.

-   responseType(string): This is used to decide what the request type
    will be.

#### Return value

> A promise will be returned.

#### Description

> If you are familiar with jQuery\'s AJAX function, then you are
> familiar with this. This is Angular\'s way of making any
> XMLHttpRequests. For most things, you will use one of the convenience
> methods that make using \$http easier.

### Convenience methods

> You can use all of the HTTP methods as functions: GET, POST, HEAD,
> PUT, DELETE, and
>
> PATCH. We will just look at GET, POST, and JSONP closely.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image143.png){width="0.4178423009623797in"
> height="0.336576990376203in"}GET, POST, and JSONP will cover most, if
> not all, of many people\'s needs for \$http. If this does not, view
> the \$http documentation at
> [https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/%24http)
> [service/\$http](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/%24http).
>
> Each function will take the URL as the first parameter and a config
> object, which is the same config object that \$http() gets.

#### GET

> This is a GET request:
>
> \$http.get(url, config)

##### Description

> This executes a simple GET request. Here is an example of a factory
> that uses
>
> \$http.get:
>
> []{#_bookmark714 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*
>
> Here is the factory:
>
> firstModule.factory(\'httpService\', \[\'\$http\', function (\$http) {
> return {
>
> test: function () { return \$http.get(\'test\', {params: \'test\'}); }
>
> }
>
> }\]);
>
> This returns a promise that the controller can then use:
>
> firstModule.controller(\'SimpleController\', \[\'\$scope\',
> \'httpService\', function (\$scope, httpService) {
>
> httpService.test().success(function (data, status) {
> console.log(data);
>
> })
>
> .error(function (data, status) { console.log(\'An error occured\');});
>
> }\]);

#### POST

> This is a POST request:
>
> \$http.post(url, config)

##### Description

> This will make a POST request. Here is a factory that makes a POST and
> an example that uses localhost. Remember that you must be running a
> server that responds to POST requests for this to work:
>
> firstModule.factory(\'httpService\', \[\'\$http\', function (\$http) {
> return {
>
> test: function () { return
> [\$http.post(\'http://localhost/post\',](http://localhost/post%27)
>
> { data: \'HEY\' }); }
>
> }
>
> }\]);

##### jsonp

> When you have to make a cross origin request, you should use JSONP.
> This will allow you to use the data instead of the request being
> blocked based on security.

### Notable services

> *Chapter 15*
>
> I will list out some useful services that can be injected, with a
> short blurb about each:

-   \$anchorScroll: This parameter allows you to scroll to the element
    in the hash

-   \$animate: This parameter allows DOM manipulations

-   \$cacheFactory: This allows caching

-   \$http: See \$http

-   \$interval: This uses Angular\'s way to call setInterval

-   \$location: This gets the information about window.location

-   \$rootScope: This returns the root scope for the application

-   \$route: See Routing

-   \$q: This allows promises to be added in our project

-   \$timeout: This uses Angular\'s way to call setTimout

> This is not a comprehensive list as Angular has many services and can
> create and include more. These are the ones that you will most likely
> use in your applications.

## Promises

> In JavaScript, many actions are asynchronous. A great example of this
> is an AJAX request. When the request is sent, you do not know when or
> even if a request will be returned. This is where promises come in.
>
> A promise is an object that will promise to run a function once an
> asynchronous event has happened. In our example, the event will be the
> request returning. This could be in a few milliseconds or longer,
> depending on the timeout setting.
>
> In addition to tracking successful events, promises can be rejected.
> This allows the object that was waiting for the response to do
> something different.
>
> ![](./images-ref/media/image147.png){width="0.417836832895888in"
> height="0.3365748031496063in"}Visit <https://promisesaplus.com/> for
> the complete specification for using promises in JavaScript. Promises
> or promise-like objects are applicable in almost any JavaScript that
> you may write.
>
> []{#_bookmark716 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

### \$q {#q-2}

> This is the service that implements promises:
>
> \$q.defer()

#### Return value

> This returns a deferred object.

#### Description

> This is the core of building and using promises. The first thing is to
> get a deferred object, which will have to resolve and reject
> functions. When the action is successful, call the resolve function;
> when it fails, call reject. Finally, return the promise with
> defer.promise.
>
> With the promise, you can call then, which takes two functions. The
> first will be called when resolve is called, and the second will be
> called when reject is called. The promise can be passed around and
> have then called multiple times.
>
> Anytime you are doing anything asynchronous, you should use promises.
> With Angular, you should use \$q as it is tied in with rootscope.
>
> Here is an example where a function will succeed when the number is
> even and fail when the number is odd. Then, it is executed twice,
> logging to the console, whether it succeeded or failed. Note that the
> function is created in the controller, but a utility function like
> this should be put a service into production:
>
> firstModule.controller(\'SimpleController\', \[\'\$scope\', \'\$q\',
> function (\$scope, \$q) {
>
> function qTest(number) { console.log(\$q);
>
> var defer = \$q.defer();
>
> if (number % 2 === 0) { defer.resolve(number);
>
> } else { defer.reject(number);
>
> }
>
> return defer.promise;
>
> };

[]{#_bookmark717 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

> qTest(2)
>
> .then(function (n) { console.log(\'succeeded!\'); }, function
>
> \(n\) { console.log(\'failed!\'); });
>
> qTest(3)
>
> .then(function (n) { console.log(\'succeeded!\'); }, function
>
> \(n\) { console.log(\'failed!\'); });
>
> }\]);

## Expressions {#expressions-2}

> Expressions are a feature of Angular. They are a subset of JavaScript
> commands in addition to some Angular function. Expressions are used in
> many places in Angular. For example, anytime you bind data, you can
> use an expression. This makes understanding expressions important.
>
> An expression will be evaluated to a value, to a true statement, to a
> function in scope, or to a variable in scope. This makes them
> powerful, but they do have some limitations.

### Expressions in JavaScript

> You can use some JavaScript, but not all JavaScript in an expression.
> Here are some of the things that you can and cannot do in JavaScript
> using expressions:

-   You can use a string, number, Boolean, array literal, or object
    literal

-   You can use any operators, for example, a + b, a && b, or a \|\| b

-   You can access properties on an object or look up values in an array

-   You can make function calls

-   You cannot use flow control statements in an expression, for
    example, an if

> statement

#### Context

> When an expression is evaluated in Angular, it will use the scope that
> it is in. This means that you can use any object or function that is
> accessible in the scope. One difference is that you will not get
> access to the global window. For example, you will not be able to use
> window.alert in an expression.
>
> []{#_bookmark718 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

## Directives

> Directives are what Angular uses to connect to the **Document Object
> Model** (**DOM**). This allows Angular to separate the concerns of
> what each part of the application should do. This means that a
> controller should never touch the DOM. A controller should only work
> through directives to change the DOM.

### Normalization

> When using directives, Angular must parse the DOM and figure out what
> directives apply to it. This is done by normalizing all the elements
> and tags. Normalization will remove any \";\" \",\" \" -\", or\" \_\".
> It will also remove x- and data- from the beginning of any attributes.
> For example, when looking for ngModel, all of the following will
> match:

-   x-ng:model

-   data-ng_model

-   ng-model

-   ng:model

> ![](./images-ref/media/image148.png){width="0.41783573928258966in"
> height="0.3365748031496063in"}If you are concerned with HTML 5
> validation, then you should use the
>
> data- normalization.

### Scope {#scope-5}

> Scopes inside directives can become very confusing. We will look at a
> few examples of the different ways to use scope.
>
> First up is just inheriting the scope. This means that the directive
> will use whatever value the variable has in the controller\'s scope.
> In this example, test will have to be set in the controller\'s scope:
>
> firstModule.directive(\'firstTest\', function () { return {
>
> template: \'This is the test directive. Test: {{test}}\'
>
> };
>
> });

#### @ binding

> *Chapter 15*
>
> The next scope modification will be to isolate the scope. You can set
> the scope property of the returned Directive Definition Object (see
> the next section). What you use here will change how the scope is
> built. An @ symbol will read in the value as a one-way bind into the
> scope. An = symbol will create a two-way bind. Each of these can have
> the name of the attribute used after them.
>
> For example, to bind one way to the attribute scope-test, use:
> \@scopeTest. Here is an example that does that:
>
> firstModule.directive(\'firstTest\', function () { return {
>
> restrict: \'AE\', scope: {
>
> test: \'@scopeTest\'
>
> },
>
> template: \'This is the test directive. Test: {{test}}\'
>
> };
>
> });
>
> This can be used like this:
>
> \<div first-test scope-test=\"Scope Test Value\"\>\</div\>

#### = binding

> Here is the example using =. The controller will need to have a
> variable in scope to pass to the directive. Here is the directive:
>
> firstModule.directive(\'firstTest\', function () { return {
>
> restrict: \'AE\', scope: {
>
> test: \'=\'
>
> },
>
> template: \'This is the test directive. Test: {{test}}\'
>
> };
>
> });
>
> The directive is then used like this:
>
> \<div first-test test=\"fromControllerScope\"\>\</div\>
>
> Notice that the attribute used to connect the scope was called test.
> This is because we only used =, instead of =nameOfVariable.
>
> []{#_bookmark720 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### & binding

> This is the final way is to pass a function in. This is done with &.
> When creating a directive with isolated scope, you run into a problem
> with letting the controller know when to take an action. For example,
> when a button is clicked, the & binding allows the controller to pass
> in the reference to a function and have the directive execute it.
>
> Here is an example directive:
>
> firstModule.directive(\'firstTest\', function () { return {
>
> restrict: \'AE\', scope: {
>
> testAction: \'&\'
>
> },
>
> template: \'\<button ng-click=\"testAction()\"\>Action!\</button\>\'
>
> };
>
> });
>
> The template now has a button that will call testAction when clicked.
> The testAction parameter that will execute is passed in from the
> controller and lives in the directive\'s scope.
>
> Here is the DOM of this directive:
>
> \<div first-test test-action=\"functionFromController()\"\>\</div\>
>
> Another situation comes up where you will need to pass information
> from the directive to the controller, for example, the event object or
> a variable from the scope. Here is an example that shows how Angular
> makes the \$event object available in functions.
>
> Here is the directive:
>
> firstModule.directive(\'firstTest\', function () { return {
>
> restrict: \'AE\', scope: {
>
> testAction: \'&\'
>
> },
>
> template: \'\<button\>Action!\</button\>\', link: function (\$scope,
> element) {
>
> element.on(\'click\', function (e) {
>
> \$scope.\$apply(function () {
>
> []{#_bookmark721 .anchor}}
>
> };
>
> });
>
> \$scope.testAction({ \$e: e, \$fromDirective: \'From Directive\' });
>
> });
>
> });
>
> *Chapter 15*
>
> The key is the link property. This runs after compilation of the
> directive and is bound to the instance of the directive. This is
> important if you have a repeating directive. Next you listen for click
> using a jQuery-like API called JQLite. From here, we must call \$apply
> because we are outside of Angular and it will not pick up any changes
> made here. Finally, we executed the expression that was passed in
> creating two variables, \$e and \$fromDirective, that will be
> available in the function in the controller.
>
> Here is what the directive will look like in the DOM:
>
> \<div first-test test-action=\"functionFromController(\$e,
>
> \$fromDirective)\"\>\</div\>
>
> The two variables, \$e and \$fromDirective, need to be called the same
> thing as you
>
> defined in the directive.

### Modifying DOM

> Angular makes very clear separation of concerns. This helps prevent
> hard-to-trace bugs from appearing. One of the separations is that
> controllers should not modify the DOM. Where does one modify the DOM
> then? In directives.
>
> Directives are the only piece of your Angular application that should
> have any knowledge of what elements are in the DOM. When a DOM
> modification needs to be made, it should be the directive that does
> it.
>
> Angular includes a jQuery-like library called jQLite. It has many of
> jQuery\'s DOM manipulation functions. If you know jQuery, you already
> know jQLite.
>
> Here is a simple example of a directive that adds a div element when a
> button is clicked. The example uses jQLite\'s append function:
>
> firstModule.directive(\'firstTest\', function () { return {
>
> restrict: \'AE\', scope: {
>
> testAction: \'&\'
>
> },
>
> []{#_bookmark722 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*
>
> template: \'\<button\>Add a DIV!\</button\>\', link: function
> (\$scope, element) {
>
> element.on(\'click\', function (e) { element.append(\'\<div\>I was
> added!\</div\>\');
>
> });
>
> }
>
> };
>
> });

### Event binding {#event-binding-2}

> In an Angular application, only directives should be listening for DOM
> events, for example, the click event. This makes it very clear where
> the handlers reside.
>
> Here is an example that binds to the click event of the element and
> logs to the console:
>
> firstModule.directive(\'firstTest\', function () { return {
>
> restrict: \'AE\', scope: {
>
> testAction: \'&\'
>
> },
>
> template: \'\<button\>Add a DIV!\</button\>\', link: function
> (\$scope, element) {
>
> element.on(\'click\', function (e) { console.log(e);
>
> });
>
> }
>
> };
>
> });
>
> Additionally, directives can let a controller pass in a function and
> execute it when an event happens (see = binding). Finally, the
> directive can even pass parameters into the controller from the
> directive. A great example is the event object that is returned from
> the event (see & binding).

### Directive definition object

> *Chapter 15*
>
> The directive definition object is the object that tells Angular how
> to build a directive. Here are the most used properties and a quick
> overview of what they do:

-   priority: A directive with a higher priority will be compiled first.
    This defaults to 0.

-   scope: See *Directives, Scope* section for a much more in depth
    overview.

-   controller: This can be confusing, but controller is used to share
    logic between directives. Another directive can share the code in
    the controller by using require and listing the name of the required
    directive. That directive\'s controller will be injected into the
    link function. The function

> will have the following definition: function(\$scope, \$element,
> \$attrs,
>
> \$transclude).

-   require: A string of the directive that is required. Prepending ?
    will make this optional, \^ will search the element and parents
    throwing an error if not found, and ?\^ will search the element and
    parents, but is optional.

> The function instance will be shared across directives.

-   restrict: This will restrict the ways you can define the directive
    in the DOM. Here are the options, with E and A being the most
    commonly used ones:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   E: This stands for element

-   A: This stands for attribute and default

-   C: This stands for class

-   M: This stands for comment

    -   template: HTML as a string or a function that returns a string
        that has the definition of function(element, attrs).

    -   templateUrl: Loads the template from this URL.

    -   link: This is where any DOM manipulations or listeners are put.
        This function will have this definition: function(scope,
        element, attrs, requiredController, transcludeFunction). If
        another directive is required, then its controller property
        would be the requiredController parameter.

> []{#_bookmark724 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

#### Controller vs link

> When to use the controller or link function can be very confusing when
> building directives. You should view the controller function as the
> interface that another directive can use. When a directive is required
> by another directive, the controller return value is injected into the
> link function. This will be the fourth parameter.
>
> The object is then accessible from link. The link function is used for
> any DOM manipulations or listeners.

### Key directives

> Here are some of the most often used directives.

#### ngApp

> This is the root of your Angular application:
>
> \<element ng-app\>\</element\>

##### Parameters

-   The ng-app(string) attribute is the name of the default module.

##### Description

> This will set the root element of the application. This can be put on
> any element, including the root HTML element.
>
> This will automatically bootstrap Angular loading the module that is
> defined in
>
> ng-app.

#### ngModel

> This binds data from the scope to elements:
>
> \<input ng-model \[ng-required ng-minlength ng-maxlength ng-pattern
> ng-change ng-trim\]\>\</input\>

##### Parameters

-   ng-model(string): This will be a variable in the scope

-   ng-required(boolean): This sets this input as required

-   ng-minlength(int): This sets the minimum length

-   ng-maxlength(int): This sets the maximum length

[]{#_bookmark725 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

-   ng-pattern(string): This is the regular expression that the value
    must match

-   ng-change(expression): This is the Angular expression that will
    execute on value change

-   ng-trim(boolean): This decides whether or not to trim the value

##### Description

> This is used to bind variables in the controller\'s scope to input
> elements (text, select, or textarea). This will be a two-way binding,
> so any changes in the variable will update all occurrences of it.
>
> Here is a simple example with text input:
>
> \<input ng-model=\"test\" type=\"text\"/\>
>
> {{test}}

#### ngDisabled

> This can disable an element:
>
> \<input ng-disabled\>\</input\>

##### Parameters

-   If the ng-disabled(expression) attribute evaluates to true, the
    input will be disabled.

##### Description

> This allows you to disable an input easily through code. The
> expression can bind to a scope variable or just evaluate what is in
> the expression.
>
> Here is a simple example that disables a text input:
>
> \<input ng-disabled=\"true\" type=\"text\"/\>

#### ngChecked

> This can make an element checked:
>
> \<input ng-checked\>\</input\>
>
> []{#_bookmark726 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

##### Parameters

-   The ng-checked(expression) attribute is the Angular expression that
    should evaluate to a JavaScript Boolean value.

##### Description

> This is the Angular way to check or uncheck a checkbox based on
> something in the controller.
>
> Here is an example:
>
> \<input ng-checked=\"true\" type=\"checkbox\"/\>

#### ngClass

> This sets the class of an element:
>
> \<element ng-class\>\</element\>

##### Parameters

-   The ng-class(expression) attribute can be a string, array, or an
    object map.

##### Description

> When the expression is a string or array, then the value of the string
> or the values of the array will be applied as classes to the element.
> These can be tied to variables in the scope, of course.
>
> Here is an example of using a string to set the class. Here is the
> style that will be applied:
>
> .double { font-size: 2em; }
>
> Here is the code to apply it:
>
> \<div ng-class=\"classString\"\>Text\</div\>
>
> \<input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"classString\" /\>
>
> The class is tied to the value of the classString variable. The input
> is bound so that any change will update the class on div. Once you
> type in double, it will apply the style.

[]{#_bookmark727 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

> Here is an example using an object map. The object\'s property name is
> the class that will be applied and the value must be true. Here is a
> similar example utilizing the same class:
>
> \<div ng-class=\"{double: classString}\"\>Text\</div\>

>
> You will notice that once you type anything into the input, the class

#### ngClassOdd and ngClassEvent

> These set the class of an odd or even element, respectively:
>
> \<element ng-class-odd\>\</element\>
>
> \<element ng-class-even\>\</element\>

##### Parameters

-   The ng-class-odd or ng-class-even(expression) attributes must
    evaluate to a string or an array of strings that will become the
    class(es) for the element.

##### Description

> These two directives are related and can even be applied to the same
> element. If a repeated element is odd, then ng-class-odd will evaluate
> and the same is true for ng-class-even.
>
> Here is an example that will make every odd element twice the size and
> every even element half the size. Here are the styles:
>
> .odd { font-size: 2em; }
>
> .even { font-size: .5em; }
>
> Here are the elements. The ul attribute creates the data to be
> repeated, and each span parameter statically sets the class to either
> odd or even. You can use variables in scope as well:
>
> \<ul ng-init=\"numbers=\[1,2,3,4\]\"\>
>
> \<li ng-repeat=\"number in numbers\"\>
>
> \<span ng-class-even=\"\'even\'\" ng-class-
> odd=\"\'odd\'\"\>{{number}}\</span\>
>
> \</li\>
>
> \</ul\>

#### ngRepeat

> This is a template that can be repeated:
>
> \<element ng-repeat\>\</element\>

##### Parameters

-   The ng-repeat(repeat_expression) attribute is similar to an
    expression, but it has a few syntax differences. Go to the
    description for the full explanation.

##### Description

> Many times you will have data that has a similar template, but changes
> for each row of data. This is where ng-repeat comes in. The ng-repeat
> function will repeat the HTML that you have for each item in the
> repeat expression.
>
> The repeat expression is an expression that tells ng-repeat what items
> are going to be looped over. Here is a rundown of some expressions:

-   item in collection: This is the classic foreach statement. It will
    loop over each item in a collection (an array, for example). The
    item parameter will be available inside the template.

-   (key, value) in collection: If your data is in an object and you
    want to be able to associate the name of the property to the value,
    then you will need to do use this.

-   item in collection track by grouping: This allows for grouping. The
    grouping will only give you one item for each unique value of
    grouping.

-   repeat expression \| filter: You can filter any of these expressions
    to give you a subset of the data.

> Here is an example using an unordered list. Here is the controller:
>
> firstModule.controller(\'SimpleController\', \[\'\$scope\', function
> (\$scope) {
>
> \$scope.items = \[{id: 1, name: \'First\' }, {id: 2, name:
> \'Second\'}\];
>
> }\]);

[]{#_bookmark729 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

> Here is the HTML for the controller:
>
> \<div ng-controller=\"SimpleController\"\>
>
> \<ul\>
>
> \<li ng-repeat=\"item in items track by item.id\"\> ID: {{item.id}}
>
> Name: {{item.name}}
>
> \</li\>
>
> \</ul\>
>
> \</div\>

#### ngShow and ngHide

> These can show or hide elements, respectively:
>
> \<element ng-show\>\</element\>
>
> \<element ng-hide\>\</element\>

##### Parameters

-   The ng-show or ng-hide(expression) attributes will be evaluated to
    true

> or false, and the element will either by shown or hidden.

##### Description

> These directives allow you to show or hide content based on the data
> in the scope.
>
> Here is an example that uses a counter to show or hide elements. You
> can use
>
> ng-hide and use the opposite logic. Here is the controller:
>
> firstModule.controller(\'SimpleController\', \[\'\$scope\', function
> (\$scope) {
>
> \$scope.count = 0;
>
> \$scope.increase = function () { \$scope.count++; };
>
> }\]);
>
> Next is the HTML:
>
> \<div ng-controller=\"SimpleController\"\>
>
> \<div ng-show=\"count == 0\"\>Count is zero: {{count}}\</div\>
>
> \<div ng-show=\"count \> 0\"\>Count is greater than zero:
>
> {{count}}\</div\>
>
> \<button ng-click=\"increase()\"\>Increase Count\</button\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> []{#_bookmark730 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand

#### ngSwitch

> This creates a switch statement:
>
> \<element ng-switch\>
>
> \<element ng-switch-when\>\</element\>
>
> \<element ng-switch-default\>\</element\>
>
> \</element\>

##### Parameters

-   ng-switch(expression): This is an expression that returns a value.
    This value will be used when evaluating ng-switch-when.

-   ng-switch-when(expression): When the value matches this expression,
    then this element will be visible.

-   ng-switch-default: This element will show when ng-switch-when does
    not match.

##### Description

> This directive works much like the JavaScript switch statement.
> Different cases are tested against, and the one that matches is used.
> If none of the cases match, then a default element is used.
>
> Here is an example that jumps between even and odd. Here is the
> controller:
>
> firstModule.controller(\'SimpleController\', \[\'\$scope\', function
> (\$scope) {
>
> \$scope.count = 0;
>
> \$scope.increase = function () { \$scope.count++; };
>
> }\]);
>
> Then comes the HTML:
>
> \<div ng-controller=\"SimpleController\"\>
>
> \<div ng-switch=\"count % 2\"\>
>
> \<div ng-switch-when=\"0\"\>Count is Even: {{count}}\</div\>
>
> \<div ng-switch-when=\"1\"\>Count is Odd: {{count}}\</div\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> \<button ng-click=\"increase()\"\>Increase Count\</button\>
>
> \</div\>

[]{#_bookmark731 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

#### ngClick

> This is used to define the click handler:
>
> \<element ng-click\>\</element\>

##### Parameters

-   The ng-click(expression) attribute is what will be evaluated when
    the element is clicked. A function can be used, and the event object
    is available using the function(\$event) function definition. Any
    other variables in scope can be passed as well, for example,
    \$indexin a repeater.

##### Description

> This directive allows you to run JavaScript on the click of an
> element. Usually, this is used with a function that is in the scope.
>
> Here is an example that will increment a scope variable. First, here
> are the controller\'s scope variables:
>
> \$scope.counter = 0;
>
> \$scope.functionFromController = function (e) { \$scope.counter++;
>
> };
>
> Next, this is the element with the ng-click directive. In this
> example, you do not use the event object, but it demonstrates how to
> get it to the controller function:
>
> \<button ng-click=\"functionFromController(\$event)\"\>Click
> Me!\</button\>
>
> {{counter}}

#### ngDblclick

> This is used to define the double-click handler:
>
> \<element ng-dblclick\>\</element\>

##### Parameters

-   The ng-dblclick(expression) function, a function can be used and the
    event object is available using the function(\$event) function
    definition. Any other variables in scope can be passed as well, for
    example, \$index in a repeater.

> []{#_bookmark732 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

##### Description

> This directive is very similar to ngClick. When the element is
> double-clicked, the expression will be evaluated.
>
> This is an example of a div that will increment a counter when
> double-clicked. Here are the controller\'s variables:
>
> \$scope.counter = 0;
>
> \$scope.functionFromController = function (e) { \$scope.counter++;
>
> };
>
> Here is the element and directive:
>
> \<div ng-dblclick=\"functionFromController(\$event)\"\>Double Click
> Me!\</div\>
>
> {{counter}}

#### ngMousedown, ngMouseup, ngMouseover, ngMouseenter, and ngMouseleave

>
> \<element ng-mouseleave\>\</element\>

##### Parameters

-   In the ng-mouse\*(expression) function, a statement or function can
    be used, and the event object is available using the
    function(\$event) function definition. Any other variables in the
    scope can be passed as well, for example, \$index in a repeater.

##### Description

> These are grouped together as they are all related. When the mouse
> takes the action (down, up, over, enter, or leave), the expression
> will be evaluated.
>
> This example is a little crazy, but it demonstrates how to use these
> events. Here is the relevant portion of the controller:
>
> \$scope.counter = 0;
>
> \$scope.functionFromController = function (e) { \$scope.counter++;
>
> };

##### Parameters

-   In the ng-mousemove(expression) function, a statement or function
    can be used, and the event object is available using the
    function(\$event) function definition. Any other variables in the
    scope can be passed as well, for example, \$index in a repeater.

##### Description

> This fires when the mouse moves. Unless the directive is on the entire

#### ngKeydown, ngKeyup, and ngKeypress

> These are used to define the key press handlers:
>
> \<element ng-keydown\>\</element\>
>
> \<element ng-keyup\>\</element\>
>
> \<element ng-keypress\>\</element\>

##### Parameters

-   In the ng-key\*(expression) function, a statement or function can be
    used, and the event object is available using the function(\$event)
    function definition. Any other variables in the scope can be passed
    as well, for example, \$index in a repeater.

#### ngSubmit

> These are used to define the submit handler:
>
> \<form ng-submit\>\</form\>

##### Parameters

-   In the ng-submit(expression) function, a statement or function can
    be used, and the event object is available using the
    function(\$event) function definition. Any other variables in the
    scope can be passed as well, for example, \$index in a repeater.

##### Description

> *Chapter 15*
>
> This directive is used to capture the submit event of a form. If the
> form does not have an action attribute, then this will prevent the
> form from reloading the current page.
>
> Here is a simple example that logs the event object to console on

#### ngFocus and ngBlur

> These are used to define the focus and blur handlers, respectively:
>
> \<input, select, textarea, a, window ng-focus\>\</input\>
>
> \<input, select, textarea, a, window ng-blurs\>\</input\>

##### Parameters

-   In the ng-focus(expression) function, a statement or function can be
    used, and the event object is available using the function(\$event)
    function definition. Any other variables in the scope can be passed
    as well, for example, \$index in a repeater.

##### Description

> The ngFocus handler will fire when the element gains focus, and ngBlur
> will fire when it loses focus. Here is an example with a text input
> that logs the event to console:
>
> \<input type=\"text\" ng-focus=\"functionFromController(\$event)\"/\>

##### Parameters

-   ng-copy, ng-cut, or ng-paste(expression): A statement or function
    can be used, and the event object is available using the
    function(\$event) function definition. Any other variables in the
    scope can be passed as well, for example, \$index in a repeater.

##### Description

> These are the events that will be fired when text is either cut,
> copied, or pasted. Here is an example that uses all three:

> \$scope.functionFromController = function (e) { console.log(e);
>
> };

## Globals

> This next group of functions can be executed from anywhere in Angular
> without having to inject them. They are mainly utility functions that
> allow you to do things easier or do things the Angular way.

### Extend

> This provides a way to combine two objects:
>
> angular.extend(srcObject, destObject)

#### Parameters

-   srcObject(object): The object that extends will copy the properties
    from

-   Destobject(object): The object that extends will copy the properties
    to

[]{#_bookmark737 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

#### Return value

> This returns a reference of destObject.

#### Description

> In JavaScript, there is no in-built way to extend an object using
> another object. This function does just that.
>
> Here is a simple example that will extend one object with the other\'s
> property:
>
> var first = { first: \'1\' }; var second = { second: \'2\' };
>
> var extended = angular.extend(first, second);
>
> //extended will be {first:\'1\', second:\'2\'}

### noop {#noop-1}

> This is the no operation function:
>
> angular.noop()

#### Parameters

-   The any or none functions are used as these functions does nothing,
    you can pass in no parameters or as many as you want.

#### Return value

> This will return undefined.

#### Description

> It is useful to have a function do no operation (noop). A great
> example of this is when you have a function as a parameter that is
> optional. If it is not passed in, you can run noop instead.
>
> This is a simple example that demonstrates the scenario explained
> earlier:
>
> function test(doSomething) {
>
> var callback = cb \|\| angular.noop; callback(\'output\');
>
> }
>
> []{#_bookmark738 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

### isUndefined

> This checks to see whether something is undefined:
>
> angular.isUndefined(object)

#### Parameters

-   The object(any type) function can be any variable.

#### Return value

> This returns a Boolean value.

#### Description

> This states whether or not the variable is defined.

### Copy

> This makes a copy of an object:
>
> angular.copy(srcObject, \[destObject\])

#### Parameters

-   srcObject(any type): This is the source object to be copied.

-   destObject(same type as srcObject): This is optional. If it is
    supplied, it would be the destination of the copy operation.

#### Return value

> This function returns the copy of srcObject. If destObject is
> supplied, it would be returned.

#### Description

> When you need to make a copy of an object instead of modifying the
> original object, use this function.

[]{#_bookmark739 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

### Bind

> This binds a function to an object:
>
> angular.bind(self, function, \[args..\])

#### Parameters

-   self(object): This will set this (the inner self-reference) in the
    function

-   Function(function): This is the function that is being bound

-   Args(any type): These are the arguments that will be bound to the
    function

#### Return value

> This is the new bound function.

#### Description

> This creates a new bound function that will execute in the context of
> self. This allows you to define a function and then execute it many
> times in different contexts. This is further extended by binding
> arguments as well.
>
> This is a contrived example, but demonstrates the principles. First is
> a function that depends on the context to execute. It will add the
> first parameter to this and multiply that result:
>
> function addAndMultiply(toAdd, toMultiply) { return (this + toAdd) \*
> toMultiply;
>
> }
>
> Next, you will use angular.bind to create a new function:
>
> var newFunc = angular.bind(4, addAndMultiply, 1);
>
> This can be executed, and the return value will be 5 times the
> multiplier. In newFunc, this is 4, and toAdd is 1, so the inner parens
> will always be 5. For example this will return 10:
>
> newFunc(2);

## Forms {#forms-3}

> Forms are a core part of sending data to a server in HTML. As a result
> of this, Angular has some extra features that work with forms.
>
> []{#_bookmark740 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

### ngModel

> Each form input will need ngModel defined to store the value in the
> scope. See
>
> *Directives*, *ngModel* for more information.
>
> Here is a simple form that binds two text inputs:
>
> \<form name=\"form\"\>
>
> First Name: \<input type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" ng-
> model=\"data.firstName\" /\>
>
> Last Name: \<input type=\"text\" name=\"lastName\" ng-
> model=\"data.lastName\" /\>
>
> \</form\>
>
> {{data.firstName}} {{data.lastName}}

### CSS classes

> Angular will automatically add CSS classes to the form and elements
> that you can then target with CSS. Here is the list of CSS classes and
> when they are applied:

-   ng-valid: This denotes that the form or element is valid

-   ng-invalid: This denotes that the form or element is invalid

-   ng-pristine: This denotes that the control has not been changed

-   ng-dirty: This denotes that the control has been changed

### Validation {#validation-2}

> Angular has features that make validation very easy. First, Angular
> will use any of the HTML 5 input types. These allow the browser to do
> some validation, but Angular will still track any errors.
>
> Next, you can use any of the built-in validation directives of
> ngModel. The list is required, pattern, minLength, maxLength, min, and
> max. See *Directives*, *ngModel* for more info about each. When an
> input fails validation, the value will not be passed into the bound
> scope variable.

[]{#_bookmark741 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

> Here is an example that sets a minimum length on firstName:
>
> \<form name=\"form\"\>
>
> First Name: \<input type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" ng-
> minlength=\"10\" ng-model=\"data.firstName\" /\>
>
> Last Name: \<input type=\"text\" name=\"lastName\" ng-
> model=\"data.lastName\" /\>
>
> \</form\>
>
> {{data.firstName}} {{data.lastName}}
>
> When a form is given a name attribute, it is bound to the scope as
> that name. When inputs are given names in a form, they are bound to
> that form. This allows you to use other directives with these values.
>
> Here is an example that will show an error message when the text input
> does not meet the minimum length of 10:
>
> \<form name=\"form\"\>
>
> First Name: \<input type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" ng-
> minlength=\"10\" ng-model=\"data.firstName\" /\>
>
> \<div ng-show=\"form.firstname.\$invalid\"\>First name must be 10
> characters!\</div\>
>
> Last Name: \<input type=\"text\" name=\"lastName\" ng-
> model=\"data.lastName\" /\>
>
> \</form\>
>
> {{data.firstName}} {{data.lastName}}
>
> The validation message will only show when the field is invalid.
>
> The form will have \$dirty, \$invalid, \$pristine, and \$valid as
> properties that can be used in directives or in scope. The inputs will
> have the same properties and additionally an \$error object that will
> have each of the failed validations as a property. In the preceding
> example, this means that form.firstname.\$error. minLength will return
> true when the input has failed that validation and false when it is
> valid.

#### Custom validators

> When you need to create your own logic, you can build a custom
> validator. You will need to create a new directive, require ngModel,
> and pass the value through the
>
> \$parsers object of the ngModel controller when it is passed into the
> link function. Then, use \$setValidity based on whether or not the
> value passed validation.
>
> []{#_bookmark742 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*
>
> Here is an example of a custom validator where you cannot have the
> value of the input set to josh:
>
> firstModule.directive(\'notJosh\', function () { return {
>
> require: \'ngModel\',
>
> link: function (scope, element, attrs, ctrl) {
> ctrl.\$parsers.unshift(function (viewValue) {
>
> if (viewValue.toUpperCase() === \'JOSH\') {
> ctrl.\$setValidity(\'notJosh\', false); return undefined
>
> }
>
> else {
>
> ctrl.\$setValidity(\'notJosh\', true); return viewValue;

}

});

> }

}

});

## Testing

> Testing should always be a major part of any development project.
> Angular has been built from the beginning to be testable. It has clear
> separation of concerns; for example, you do not need to build a full
> DOM to test a controller. Angular also uses dependency injection
> everywhere, which makes mocking up objects very easy.

### Unit testing with Jasmine and Karma

> **Jasmine** and **Karma** are two tools that allow you to quickly and
> easily test your Angular code.

#### Jasmine

> This is the actual unit testing library that we will use. Jasmine is a
> behavior-driven testing framework and is really easy to write.

#### Karma

> *Chapter 15*
>
> Karma is the test runner that will watch your files and automatically
> kick off your tests. It runs on Node.js, so you must have it
> installed. You can then install Karma with npm:
>
> install karma-jasmine
>
> Karma can watch your test files and rerun them whenever any of the
> files change. You can also debug tests in the browser if there are any
> issues. It is a great complement to Jasmine, and Google recommends
> both for testing.

### ngMock

> The ngMock handler is used to help mock up your application when
> testing. When testing, you will not want to create an entire DOM to
> load just one module. This is where ngMock can create a controller
> instance for use, and we can then test it.

#### Module {#module-2}

> This allows you to load a module:
>
> module(moduleName)

##### Parameters

-   The moduleName(string) function take

##### Description

> You do not have a root element to put ng-app on, so module allows us
> to load a module to get access to its controllers, services, and
> directives. You should only use this function in tests after loading
> ngMock.

#### Inject

> This gets the Angular inject services:
>
> inject(toBeInjected)

##### Parameters

-   The toBeInjected(function) function works much like other injected
    functions. List out the objects to be injected, and they will be
    available in the function body.

> []{#_bookmark744 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*

##### Description

> Use inject to get access to built-in Angular services, such as
> \$controller and
>
> \$compile, or use it to get access to a loading module\'s services.
>
> Inject can load dependencies if they are wrapped with underscores. For
> example, inject would load \$compile if it is used as \_\$compile\_.
> This is done because in a test, we will need to create a reference to
> the \$compile service, and most likely, we would want to use \$compile
> as the variable name. The underscores allow you to inject it and use
> the \$compile variable.

#### \$httpBackend

> This can create a mock response:
>
> \$httpBackend.when(requestType, url, \[requestParameters\],
> \[headers\])
>
> \$httpBackend.expect(requestType, url, \[requestParameters\],
> \[headers\])
>
> \$httpBackend.respond(response)

##### Parameters

-   requestType(string): This is the HTTP method of the request

-   url(string): This is the URL of the request

-   requestParameters(object): These are the parameters of the request

-   headers(object): These are the headers for the request

-   response(string, object): This is the response of the request

##### Return value

> This returns a handler that can call respond.

##### Description

> Making AJAX calls is a perfect example of something that should not be
> done in a unit test. There are too many things out of your control for
> unit testing. The
>
> \$httpBackend handler is provided by ngMock so that you can create a
> mock response.
>
> The handler must match the expected method and URL at the very least.
> You can also match the optional parameters and headers if you plan on
> making specific requests with them.

[]{#_bookmark745 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

> When the request is matched, you can send back a string or object as
> the response. This allows you to create a test that uses
> \$httpBackend, as you know what the response is going to be.
>
> The difference between expect and when is that expect has to be called
> in the test, whereas when does not have that requirement.

### Unit testing controllers

> Here is an example of a simple unit test for a controller. First, you
> must create a controller and then load it in our test:
>
> var firstModule = angular.module(\'firstModule\', \[\'ngMock\'\]);
> firstModule.controller(\'SimpleController\', \[\'\$scope\', function
> (\$scope) {
>
> \$scope.test = \'HEY!\';
>
> }\]);
>
> You can now create the test. In the test, you must load the
> firstModule module, inject \$controller, and create an instance of
> SimpleController. Here is the test:
>
> describe(\'SimpleController\', function () { var scope = {};
>
> var simpleCtrl; beforeEach(module(\'firstModule\'));
>
> it(\"should have a scope variable of test\", inject(function
> (\$controller) {
>
> expect(scope.test).toBe(undefined);
>
> simpleCtrl = \$controller(\'SimpleController\', { \$scope: scope
>
> });
>
> expect(scope.test).toBe(\'HEY!\');
>
> }));
>
> });

### Unit testing directives

> This example will show you how to test a directive. First, create the
> directive:
>
> firstModule.directive(\'simpleDirective\', function () { return {
>
> restrict: \'E\', scope:{
>
> test: \'@\'
>
> },
>
> []{#_bookmark746 .anchor}*[AngularJS -- Google\'s In-Demand
> Framework]{.underline}*
>
> replace: true,
>
> template: \'\<div\>This is an example {{test}}.\</div\>\'
>
> };
>
> });
>
> Next, you will need to load the module, inject \$compiler and
> \$rootscope, compile
>
> the directive, and finally, start the digest loop at least once to
> bind any values:
>
> describe(\'simpleDirective\', function () { var \$compile,
> \$rootScope; beforeEach(module(\'firstModule\'));
>
> beforeEach(inject(function (\_\$compile\_, \_\$rootScope\_) {
>
> \$compile = \_\$compile\_;
>
> \$rootScope = \_\$rootScope\_;
>
> }));
>
> it(\'should have our compiled text\', function () { var element =
> \$compile(\'\<simple-directive
>
> test=\"directive\"\>\</simple-directive\>\')(\$rootScope);
>
> \$rootScope.\$digest(); expect(element.html()).toContain(\'This is an
> example directive.\');
>
> });
>
> });

### Unit testing services

> The final testing example will test a service. First, create a
> service:
>
> firstModule.factory(\'firstFactory\', \[\'\$http\', function (\$http)
> { return {
>
> addOne: function () {
>
> return \$http.get(\'/test\', {})
>
> .then(function (res) { return res.data.value + 1;
>
> });
>
> }
>
> }
>
> }\]);

[]{#_bookmark747 .anchor}*Chapter 15*

> Next, you will have to load the module, inject \$httpBackend and the
> service factory, create a response, and load the response. Notice the
> use of \$httpBackend.flush(). This will send the response to any open
> requests:
>
> describe(\'firstFactory\', function () {
>
> var \$httpBackend, testingFactory, handler;
>
> beforeEach(module(\'firstModule\')); beforeEach(inject(function
> (\_\$httpBackend\_, firstFactory) {
>
> \$httpBackend = \_\$httpBackend\_;
>
> handler = \$httpBackend.expect(\'GET\', \'/test\')
>
> .respond({ value: 1 }); testingFactory = firstFactory;
>
> }));
>
> it(\'should run the GET request and add one\', function () {
> testingFactory.addOne()
>
> .then(function (data) { expect(data).toBe(2);
>
> });
>
> \$httpBackend.flush();
>
> });
>
> });
